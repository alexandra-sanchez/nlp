' We must now return to Say; whore we
left the Niger, and proceed on our travels
eastward, in order to visit one of the most
populous -and powerful regions of Africa.
Lhis country: has the general appollation of
the; [Towssa States, and contains several small
and tributary kingdoms or provinces, ag Gan-
do, Sockotu, Katsena.

Canoes of all sizes are ready to transport
you and. your effects across the river‘at Say.
But if your luggage is very bilky, you must
have one of the larger sort. ‘Such a boat is
about forty feet in length, and:four to five!
fect in width in the middle; formed of two;
hollowed trunks of trées sewn together in the |
centre. It till carry three camels, The:
stream is here contracted by a rocky bank, |
and is only about 700 yards broad, but has |
a noble appearance.

The main route from this place eastward is |
pretty much frequented; and the road is va-!
ried, being by turns rocky, woody, and swam- !
py: The people are poor, and the Village |
and towns of no particular interest. But;
here is a salt-hamlet, of which there are sev- |
eral in’ this locality! It adjoins a large
mound of rubbish about 200 yards square,
and from 20 to 50 in height, formed of the
mould of the valley from which the saline
partieles have been extracted. The carth of
ihe salt vale is put into large funnels made |
of straw and reeds ; so that when water is;
poured upon the carth, it is strained through
the funnels. Being received into vessels
placed underneath, it is boiled; and the sedi-
ment is formed into small loaves of salt. ‘The
product is of a greyish yellow color, and of
tolerable quality, especially for culinary pur-
poses. ‘The natives also extract salt from the
ashes of burnt grass, which has grown in a
brackish soil. Other kinds of salt are brought
from the desert ; but the produce of the pits
is of very different qualities.

This country, like that on the other sidé of
Say, is inhabited by Foolhe and Songhay,
and is in a very distracted condition, ‘T'rav-
cllers must keep a constant watch, to prevent
being surprised by sonie band of marauders.
The principal towns contains seven or cight
thousand inhabitants, and are all walled and
fortified. A singular incident. here befel one
of Dr. Barth’s camels. Tt went raving mad,
leaped about in the most ludicrous manner,
kicked in every direction, and at length fell
tu the ground. .

The next place of importanco is Gando,
the capital of the Kebbi district, and residence
of a powerful Pullo prince. He is a nephew
of the reformer Othman, and like all his rela-
tives, is a stern and bigoted Mussulman.
He gpends his life ina sceluded, monkish
mannor, and would not allow Dr. Barth to see |
bis holy face. The traveller was obliged to
Ieave its presents in the palace, without speak-
ing to his august occupant. © But the sancti-
ty of the sultan did not prevent his being
quite alive to his temporal interests, and try-
ing to extort the utinost from a straiger. At
first, he signified his approval of tlie presents
sent to him; but having heard that his guest
had given a pair of silver mounted pistols to
the emir of Sockotu, lie refused to let him ‘de-

) Was very mortifying, as the pistols were re-
served for a person of more importance in
furthering the traveller’s interest ; but the
haly man would not be content with less. ‘The
town, which is situated ina narrow valley
and surrounded with walls, is only neted for
ifs onions and cotton cloth.

Sockotu, or rather Sackatu, is tho capital of
the province of Aunfara, and of one the chief
and most populous towns in Central Africa.
It is known to Kuropeans as the place where
the gallant Clapperton died, worn out with
sufferings and disappointments.

The inhabitants are chiefly Felattas,

fore, a Muhometan city, though the people
are not so intolerant asin Timbuctu and
Jonné. The situation of the town is healthy,
being on a long ridge; but an adjacent marsh
and stagnant pouls cause it to be very agucish.

A stranger is first introduced to the vizier
The vizier, during Clapperton’s
sojourn in the town, wasan elderly man, very
polite, speaking Arabic exceedingly well.
‘The sultan scemed to live in greater simpli-
city than some of the ebiefs of inferior pluces.
Clapperton passed through several guard
houses, and was then introduced to Sultan
Bello, seated on a small carpet, between two
pillars which supported the roof.
and pillars were painted blue and white, in the
Moorish taste; and on the back wall was the
sketch of an ornamented fire-sereen.

Sultan Bello’s brother sold to Clapporton
some of the remains of Major Denham’s bag-
gage, which had been lost in a military foray

possessed a great many slaves ; and I saw

He affirmed that it: would be his greatest
pleasure to help in drawing the nations to-
gether in bonds of amity, which would con-
dyee to the good of all ; and professed great
regret that Captain Clapperton, called Abd
Allah (‘servant of God??) had died in his
dominions, fearing lest this untoward’ event
might arouse the suspicion of Kuropeans.

At the next interview, when Dr. Barth
went to the palace with his presents, he
found Aliyu in a room built of reeds, sitting
ona wooden divan. The sultan is a stout
man, of middle size, with a round, fat, good-
humored face ; inheriting the features of his
mother, who was a Lowssa slave, rather than
those of his father. He was quite frank, and
had thrown off his paternal reserve, not even
using the face-covering worn by Pullo princes
in the presence of strangers, ITis dress con-
sisted of little more than a grey tobe or
smock-shirt. He was greatly pleased with
his presents, chiefly consisting of brocaded
garments of various colors, a carpet, razors,
looking-glasses, sugar and spices; but was
enraptured with the last offering, a pair of
silver mounted pistols, the like of which he
had never seen. With childish joy he fre-
quently exclaimed, “IT thank you, I thank
you ; God bless you, God bléss you.”

As the sultan was on the eve of departing
on a short expedition, and the ctiquette of
the country did not allow a distinguished
stranger to leave in his absence, Dr. Barth
was obliged to wait in the capital till his re-
turn. But Aliyu sent him 100,000 kurds,
equivalent to about 102, to defray his house-
hold expenses in the interim. Le also
furnished him with all the papers that he
desired. What a pity that. other sovereigns
do not resemble this negro prince in his
pacific and enlightened policy! Verily all
the wisdom of the world does not dwell in
Kurope and America,

One would like to see a real “city of the
desert,” if it were not for the dangers and
difficulties of the journey. In twenty days’
hard travelling from Wurno, you could reach
the ancient and royal city of Agades, once
the capital of a Desert empire, now ina half
deserted and ruinous condition. The danger
from robbers in this district is not great, if you
travel in eempany with one of the large salt
caravans, which aro under.tho protection of
powerful chieftains; thougli these are some-

Kngland, of which ho had never heard,
though he had used “English powder.”’ He
expressed great indignation on hearing that
tho travellers had been ‘wronged by tribes
under his jurisdiction, who Trad deprived
them of presents intended for the sultan him-
self. Ile vowed vengeance for this offence,
which he afterwards made a pretext for en-
riching himself with the spoils of tkeso tribes ;
since one part of his. revenue’ consists of fines
levied on marauders. . The rest of his income
is derived from the presents or contributions
received at his accession, and:a small tax on
foreign merchaitdise and salt.

‘This sultan had -been deposed a few years
previously, to.make way for another; but a
restoration was effected ; and subsequently,
another change was made; so that, though
the people adhere to ono family of kings,
they seem to think that achange of porsons
“is lightsome.’’ His re-itistallation was now
at hand; and Dr. Barth witnessed the pro-
cession. ‘he ceremony,"was as. follows:
Abd Hl Kader was conducted from his
private apartment to the public hall. Then
the chiefs of two tribes, Itisan and Kelgores,
asked him to sit down on a couch made of
palm trees, covered-with mats and a carpet.
ie did so, but kept his fect on the ground,
till the chiefs of the Kelowi desired him to
lift them up on tho divan, and so recline
fully in astern . style. ‘This was to show
the joint investure of their new sovereign by
all these tribes. A procession was then
formed to the chapel or tomb of a Mahometan
saint outside the town, where the sultan said
his prayers, and on his return the company
dispersed.

In the procession, the new prince rode first
on a fine horse of the Taw, :i, a most famous
breed, wearing a fine robe of colored cotton
and silk, with a blue bernvose over it, andin
his girdle a golden-handled scimitar. . ‘Then
came several officers of the household, Next
rode the chiefs of the Itisan and Kelgeres, in
full dress ‘and armor, consisting of : sword,
dagger, long spear, ancl immense shield.
The sultan of the Kelowi followed, witha
long train of his people on swift camels.
‘The men of the town closed the’ procession,

omé on horselfack, but most on foot, armed,
eased in thicir best finery.’ Several of

Wo to the unhappy traveller who deviates
from’ the ‘proper track, and gots*lost ‘in, the
desert! Llis fate may.be gathered from the
narrow. escapo of Dr. Barth, who left his com-
panions to visit'‘a remarkakle mountain near
which the ‘caravan: would’ pass. He: took
with him u few dry biscuits and dates, :which.
he soon found to be a very bad kind of food
without water. As the sun reached the ze-,
nith, the traveller got tired and exhausted,
and found at last that he was lost. In vain
he fired his pistols, to’ give a signal to- his
friends, and ascendcd. one mound after an-
other, to try and catch a glimpse of the:cara-

on the-ground, feverish and restless, longing.
for the dawn of day.. Collecting all his
strength, he then load.ed his pistols with a
heavy charge, and. fired once, twiec. The
sound stemed loud ¢ nough to wake the dead;

‘Twas sitting in the shade before my '
door, with Sidi Sheik, the sultan’s fighi, '

when an ill-looking wieteh, with a fiend-like
grin on his countenaneé, came and placed
himself directly before me. I asked Sidi
Sheik who he was? He answered. with great
composure, ‘ ‘I'he exeeationer.’ I ‘instant-
ly ordered my servants toturn him out. ‘Be
patiént,” said Sidi Sheik, laying his hand on
mine, ‘he visits the first people in Sockotu,
and they never allow lim to go away without
giving him a few goora nuts, or money to
buy them.’ In compliance with this hint, I
requested forty cowries to be given to the
fellow, with strict orders never again to cross
my threshold.’ ‘Phis villain had applied to
the governor for the office of executioner,
which his own brother then held, boasting of
his superior adroitness in the family vocation.
The governor said, “We will try;—go fetch
your brother’s head.” The wretch immedi-
ately went to his brother’s house, and find-
ing him quietly sitting in the doorway, struck
off his head at one blow with a sword, giv-
ing him no warning whatever of his mission.
He carried the bleeding trophy to the gover-
nor, and claimed the promised office, which
was “given to him. Ife has had plenty of
work to do, ‘he capital punishments inflict-
ed in Sudan are beheading, impaling, and
crucifixion ; the first being inflicted on Ma-
hometans, the two latter on pagans. Wretches
linger on the cross for a period of three
days, before death terminates their sufferings,

During Clapperton’s stay in Sockotu, pro-
visions were regularly sent him from the sul-
tan’s table on pewter dishes, with the London
stamp ; and one day, meat was served to
him ma white wash-hand basin of English
manufacture.

A little north of Sockotu is Wurno, the
capital of the great sovereign who reigns
over the TTowssa States, holding the provinces
which we have described in a kind of subjec-
tion as tributaries. His empire extends to
Songhay on the west, and Bornu on the east.
He isa liberal man, not haunted with the
ghost of Mahometan bigotry or asceticism.
At the same time he wants energy of char-
acter, and is only a nominal warrior, Tis
dominions are, therefore, held with a feeble
hand, and the border country is in a state of
much insecurity and distraction. This is
specially the case on the western side, where
the stern followers of Othman wield a firm
sway, and are anxious to extend the reforms
(so called) of a stern Islamism. Aliyu, on
the other hand, is content with the present
state of things, and has no zeal for prozelyt-
ism ; as is evident from his allowing a pagan
people to skirt his castern frontier. We
shall glance at these Bedce when we come
to them in our journey. Aliyu, on hearing
of Dr. Barth’s arrival, sent him a supply of
provisions, consisting of an ox, four fat sheep,
and two largo sacks of rice, each containing
about two hundredweight; intimating his desire
to see him immediately. He was found
sitting. on a raised platform under e tree in
front. of his dwelling. He received the tray
eller with great’ cordiality, shaking hands
with him, and begging him to sit down in
front.of him. He said that he had heard of
ai hig movements, had received his letter
sent through the Sultan of Agades, and enter-
ed heartily into the views of his mission ; so
he was ‘ready to form a commercial treaty
with the Queen of England, and engage to
protect British merchants and_ travellers.

differs in this respect from the lion of central
Africa, whose mance is large and beautifal.
These wild beasts hunt in companies of foar
and five, and will not hesitate to steal a
camel. ,

The people of the desert dwell in small
villages of huts, built of mats attached to
stalks of corn or to young trees, and roofed
with branches covered with hides. They
subsist chiefly by cattle breeding, hunting,
stealing, and convoying caravans, ‘Their
manners are very free, aud the morals of both
sexes are described as extremely loose.

The naturalist could find some objects of
interest in the desert. There is a plant,
called in Howssa “kumkuminia,”’ a species
of cuphorbia, which grows to the height of
nearly two feet. It is very poisonous, and
is used to anoint the tips of arrows. ‘Then
there is the ‘‘aido,”’ a grass covered with
large and strong prickles, very distressing to
naked feet. ne part of the country is
nearly covered with the slseleplas gigantea,
on the leaves of which the cattle feed. It
has a milky juice Cused by pagans to foment
their “‘giya,’’) which spots clothes, and even
injures the hair of horses. Acacias, dwarf
laurels, and other stunted plants grow in the
more fertile places.

Now suppose that we could be transported
across this desert reyion, which we gladly
leave to its present vecupants, and that we
could be set down in Awades itself. This
once far-famed city deserves a little notice,
Tt used to be surrounded with. a wall, but
this has disappeared from one side, and what
remains is in a dilapidated state. The south-
ern part of the town is almost entirely de-
sorted, and many ruined houses are found in
every strect. In the zenith of its prosperity,
Agades had a cireuit of about three miles and
a half, and probably contained a population
of fifty thousand souls. Its greatest decline
took place at the close of last century,
when the conquests of the ‘Tawareks
destroyed its prineipal markets; and a tide
of emigration set in for Towssa. Dr, Barth
estimates the present number of inhabited
houses tg be six or seven hundred, and the
inhabitants to be about seven thousand. A
large portion of the male population are al-
ways from home, on mercantile expeditions
of their own, or in conveying caravans, s0
that the armed force of the place at any one
time seldom musters more than six hundred.

More than fifty houses are raised to two
stories, or rather have a garret planted on
their flat roofs. ‘Ihe better sort have a
vestibule, with inner apartments, and a
spacious court-yard, in which is an enormous
bedstead. Purtle-doves, goats, and young
ostriches may be found running about here,
and plenty of children. In the back court
are soveral apartments for the wonen. ‘The
great bedstead is a piece of furniture peculiar
to the Songhay tribes. In Agades, it is like a
small house built of strong boards, and fur.
nished with a canopy of mats. ‘The dwellings
require to be spacious, as they sometimes con-
tain a little clan of people.

Dr. Barth was introduced to the sul-
tan, who saluted the traveller’ and imme-:
diately entered into a conversation about’

aa, describe some parts of their desert
journey as having been very toilsome and
distressing. The caravan lost’ many camels
through fatigue ; and they often passed nu-
merous skeletons of unhappy persons, chiefly

way to ‘Tripoli. Near one well they counted
more than a hundred, some of which had the
skin still attached to the bones. During a
day’s journey of twenty-six miles, they passed
107 of these skeletons. No wonder! ‘The
poor slaves are marched with chains round
their legs and necks, with a scanty supply of
provision, and with no warm clothing. Their
privations, therefore, must be great; for the
traveller says, “it Was the ‘ciglth day since
our caraels had ‘tasted water,~—-and at ‘night
it blew a hurricane.” Again he writes,
“During the last two days, we had passed
‘on an average from:sixty to eighty or nincty
skeletons each day; but the numbers that
lay about the wells at El Hammar were
countless ; those of two women, whose per-
feet and regular teeth bespoke them young,
were particularly shocking. ‘Their arms still
remained clasped round each other, as they
had expired ; although the flesh had long
since perished, by being exposed to the burn-
ing rays of tho sun, and the blackened bones
only were left. The nails of the fingers, and
some of the sinews of the hand, also remain-
ed and part of the tongue’ of one of them
still appeared through the teeth, We had
now passed six days of desert, without the
slightest appearance of vegetation, and a lit-
tle branch of the sway (Capparis sodada)
was brought me here, as 2 comfort and a cu-
riosity. On the following day we had alter-.
nately plains of sand and loose gravel, and
had a distant view of some hills to the west.

We have carefully perused the correspon-
dence between the United States and British
Governments, growing out of Capt. Wilkes’s
procedure in the Mason Slidell capture. The
Secretary of State has argued the case. aglmi-
rably, perhaps justly, for Great Britain ;
stating, however, that the doctrine advocated
ig sound American doctrine, which has heen
maintained and contended for by the United
States, for more than half a century. We
had supposed that some great principle, which
England, heretofore, has not acknowledged,
was now about being recognized, and firmly
established.

But, if we read aright, in this, we are mis-
taken, and the decision arrived at does little
more than dispose of this isolated case ; the
great question, so long pending, relative to
the nature and extent of neutral rights in
peace as well as in war, still remaining un-
settled unless by implication. Mr. Seward
treats the question under five heads ; four of
which he determines in our favor, and the
fifth against us, thereby vitiating the whole
prior proceedings, and rendering it obligatory
upon us to return the captured persons.
Ile decides that the persons and dispatches
were contraband ;—that Captain Wilkes
might lawfully stop and search the Trent ;—
that he did lawfully, and properly do so ;—
that finding“t¢ contraband persons on board,
he had a right to capture them ; dué that he
did not exercise the right to capture in the

LETTERS AND ESSAYS.

BY WM. J. WATKINS.
Ayy Arnon, Mich, Dee. 18, 1861.

Tt is a favorite dogma of.slaveholders and
their eraven apologists, that ‘negroes can’t
take care of themselves.” ‘Their law, their
science, their ethics, their theology, and their
religion, are thoroughly impregnated with the
virus of this palpable absurdity. ‘The negro,
they tell us, thrives best in servitude, his nor-
mal condition. fe must have a master, 2
guardian—some one to look after him. It
is distinctly affirmed that he does not possess
those qualities which are a size qua non to
the development of the endire man. It is
said that he is deficient in judgment, in fore-
thought, in the ability to plan and to exe-
cute, and that, left to himself, thrown uppn
his own resources and responsibilities, he will,
sooner or later, relapse into barbarism.

Our imaligners roll these premises as a
sweet morsel under their yeracious(?) tongues,
and jump with all the dexterity of the most
accomplished acrobat, to the conclusion that
those who insist upon having us treated, in
all respects, as men, are practising a philoso-
phy in direct hostility to the Divine economy,
and forcing us into an uncongenial element,
one for which we have no natural adaptation,
and in which we must inevitably wither, droop,
and die.

But the facts, the facts! What are the
facts? For facts, stubborn and immutable,
are worth more than theories, unless the latter
are supported by the former.

It is safe to affirm that the human race is
a unit—that man is the same in all ages.

He may differ in certain phenomenal aspects,
under the modifying play of certain circum-
stances; but in no respect are the laws of
his being altered or amulled. One speci-
men of a fully developed negro, a pure ne-
gro, (none of your half-and-half arrange-
ments, ) is suflicient to prove the title of the
whole race to equal rights as men. It will
not do to argue that such a negro is an ex-
ception, and proves nothing. The most learn-
ed monkey cannot make a mathematician,
nor can the wisest and most wonderful ele-

The settlement contains 1,000 inhabitants,

We understand, from reliable authority, that
it has been a rule in this settlement, that no
clothing nor provisions of any kind should be
received. Although many landed here,
stripped of every thing but life and health,
they were only placed in a way to support
themselves, and toll that their own right arm}.
must do the rest. The health and morals of
the settlers are good ; there has been no case
of crime during the last year. Nothing that
intoxicates is made or sold in the settlement,
and not a drunken man has been seen in the
settlement during nino years. The various
trades are liberally represented among them.
They have also several mills, factories, ete.

I lectured to these people in their church,
apparently much to their edification. I never
addressed an audience with whom I was more
delighted.

Now, these persons have had more to contend
against, both in the States and in the Canadas,
than any community of white men to be found
on God's green earth, When Mr. King was
negotiating for the lands for their settlement,
the whites in the neighborhood became horti-
bly afraid. The “abomination of desolation”
was coming. ‘They raved and swore, and
wrote threatening letters. But the negroes
came, and conquered. ‘To-day, I point thom

as evidence of the equality of the race.
When in the cotton fields, the rice fields and
sugar plantations of our Barbary States, they
loomed up in the world’s horizon, a huge,
grim, black monument of the brutality and
barbarism of American civilization, and the
infidelity and atheism of American Chris-

Nature’s noblemen; and as the wilderness
resounds with their well-directed blows, and
the fire-side sparkles with the cheerful smiles
of the’r wives and little ones, they tella
simple, truthful story of their rights, which
will be heard, at this critical hour, above the
din of contending armies. ‘Can’t take care
of themselves !”’

PATRIOTISM OF COLORED AMERICANS.
Ata Mass Convention of the colored cits
izens of Ohio, held at Cleveland, Sept. 9th,
1852, the orator of the occasion, William H.
Day, Esq., in the course of his address, said :

my side—his blood spouted upon my clothes,
which I wore for weeks. My nearest blood,
except that which runs in my veins, was shed
for liberty. My orily brother was shot dead
instantly in the Revolution. Liberty is dear
to my heart; I cannot endure the thought
that my countrymen should be slaves.

When stationed in the State of Rhode
Island, the regiment te which I belonged -
was once ordered to what was called a flank-~
ing position,—that is, upon a place which
the encmy must pass in order to come round
in our rear, to drive us from the fort. This
pass was every thing, both to them and to
us; of course, it wasa post of imminent
danger. ‘They attacked us with great fury,
but were repulsed. They reinforeed, and
attacked us again, with more vigor and de-
termination, and again were repulsed.
Againthey reinforced, and attacked us the
third time, with the most desperate courage
and resolution, but.a third time were re-
pulsed. ‘The contest was fearful. Our po-
sition was hotly disputed and as hotly main-
tained.

“ But [ have another object in view in
stating these facts. 1 would not be trumnpet-
ing my own acts ; the only reason why I
have named myself in connection with this
transaction is to show that I know whereof
I affirm. There was a black regiment in
the same situation. Yes, a regiment of ne-
groes, fighting for our liberty and indepen-
denec,—not awhite man among then but
the officers, —stationed in this same dangerous
and responsible position. Had they been
unfaithfel, or given way before the enemy,
all would have been lost. Three times in
succession were they attacked, with most
desperate valor and fury, by well disciplined
and veteran troops, and three times did they
successfully repel the assault, and thus pre-
serve ourarmy from capture. They fought
though the war. They were brave, hardy
troops. They helped to gain our liberty and
independence.

‘©Now, the war is over, our freedom is
ained—whatis to be done with these colored
soldiers, who have shed their best blood in its
defence? Must they he sent off out of the
country, because they are black? or must
they be sent back into slavery, now they
have risked their lives and shed their blood
to secure the freedom of their masters? I
ask, what became of these noble colored
soldiers? Many of. them, I fear, were ta-
ken back to the South, and doomed-to the
fetter and the chain.

“ And why is it, that the colored inhabi-
tants of our nation, born in this country,
and entitled to all the rights of freemen, are
held inslavery?» Why, but because they are
black? ‘T have often thought that, should

hands, and considerable anxiety is felt as
the way they will play it. ‘They have worked
the people up to Secession heat by a load of
grievances, of which the General Government
must “bear the censure, and thus they are
prepared to avail themselves of any emer-
gency that may suddenly arise, and turn it
to their own advantage. A. few months
since, the Mexican people were Joyal toa
man, and the Secession feeling was confined
toa few heartless politicians ; but now dis-
satisfaction and distrust are spreading fay
and wide, and conrplaints loud and deep are
heard on every side.

The end of all this is shrouded in dark-
ness; Lut those who tow these people
tremble for the result, when they look on
what is passing around them, and judge by
the past what the future may bring forth.”

aasee -

We are constantly being told, (and
thereby eajoled,) by one official after anoth-
er, week following week, that this is to be a
short war. So in substance, if not actual
phraseology, has said the Secretary of War,
the Scerctary of State, the recognized Com-
mander-in-ehief, and the President himself.
‘One has confidently declared that the troops
would be enabled to jom in the Christmas
gambols at home ; another, that they would
there participate in the joyous grectings of
the incoming year; another that the end
would certainly be prior to the rigors of win-
ter setting in. It has been oracularly an-
nounced, that astounding events would be
made manifest within a given time, already
past, said events still remaining undeveloped;
and it has also been in a seer-like manner
predicted, that the rebellion would be crushed
out utterly and forever, in the space of so
many designated days. ‘The present con-
dition and aspect of affairs leads us in the
language of other times to give the warning
ery, “Beware of false prophets.”
Notwithstanding all the flattering predic-
tions, recont advices from Washington state
that an order has been issued from the Ord-
nance Department to the largest three can-
non foundries in the country, to manufac-
ture to their utmost capacity, 10-inch colum-

It is not, however, my intention to dis-
prove by logical argument, the absurd theory
to which I have adverted, but to call atten-
tion to a living, tangible demonstration of its
incorrectness. Such a demonstration we
have in the establishment, growth, and pres-
ent condition of a settlement of fugitive slaves
in the township of Buxton, C. W., a settle-
ment conecrning which much has been_ said
and written. Jet us look at the naked, un-
varnished facts, and let us reflect that the
persons who compose this settlement are refu-
gces from the horrors and iniquities of sla-
very—American slavery. The lash and
the iron have drank their blood. Both
Church and State have hurled their poi-
soned arrows at their bleeding hearts. ‘The
system of which they have been the vic-
tims cannot be described. I will be par-
doned if I indulge in a simile more
truthful than pocticul. Slavery is like an
old goose, which cuts everything before tt,
and kills everything behind it, Thank God !
it’s time is short.

This settlement was formed in 1849, for
the purpose of providing colored persons in
Canada with homes. It was incorporated by
Act of Parliament in 1850. It contains
about eighteen square miles of country, in
the township of Buxton, and County of Kent,
Canada West. ‘he land was purehased
from the Government, by Rey. Wm. King
of Louisiana, (formerly a slaveholder,) at a
cost of $18,000. It is divided into farms
of fifty acres each, with a road sixty-six feet
wide, running past each farm. The houses,
which are mostly built of round or hewed
logs, are set at a short distance from the road,
with a grass plat in front, and the garden and
yard enclosed with a neat and substantial
fenee. Some of the early settlers have good
frame houses, well furnished. Most of them
aro whitewashed, and covered partly with the
grape vine. ‘This gives to the dwellings a
neat and beautiful appearance. The settlers
have cleared from ten to thirty acres of land,
built their houses, and provided their own
farming implements, without “taking the hat
around.” Some whom I visited farm 100,
and some 150 acres. ‘Their farms are as well
cultivated as any I saw in the West. Some
who were fugitives when they came into
Canada, without one cent, are living on ex-
cellent farms, cleared and paid for by them-
selves. I may mention Mr. George Hatter,
who owns and farms 150 acres, Green Due,
Henry R. ‘Thomas, Isaac Riley, and a num-
ber of others, all of whom farm 100 aeres,
and more. Thomas W. Stringer and A. D.
Shadd, are excellent and extensive farmers.
They are also counsellors, and are very highly
esteemed. ‘The lands are well adapted to
pasture, and some good horses are raised by
tho settlers. ‘Lhe principal erop is wheat,
but Indian corn, peas, oats and harley, grow
well. The settlers have paid, without any
assistance, about $10,000 for their lands, the
price eharged them per acre being $2.50, the
actual cost to the first buyers. In two or

three years they expect to pay for the whole.

“We have had in Ohio, until very recently,
and if they are living, have here now, a few
colored men who have thus connected us with
the past. I have been told of one, recently, in
the southern portion of the State.

“Another, of whom we all know, has resid-
ed, for many years, near Urbana, Champagn
county. He was invited to, and expected
at, this meeting. Father Stanup (as he is fa-
miliarly called) has lived to a good old age.
Tle has been afflicted with recent sickness, and
it may have prostrated him permanently. ‘The
frosts of a hundred winters will shrivel any
oak ; the blasts of a century will try any vi-
tality. ‘The aged soldier must soon die. O,
that liberty, for which he fought, might be be-
queathed to his descendants! The rea-ization
of that idea would smooth his dying pillow,
and make the transit from this to another
sphere a pleasant passage. CU am eredibly
informed, that the age of Mr. Stanup is one
hundred and nine ; that he was with General
Washington ; and that his position, in’ this
respeet, has been recognized by officers of
the Governient.”

Purther on, Mr. Day said :-—T think we
have demonstrated this point, that if colored
people are among your Pompeys, and Cuffees,
and Uncle Toms, they are also among your
heroes. ‘They have been on Lakes Erie and
Champlain, upon the Mediterranean, in
Florida with the Creeks, at Schuylkill, at
Hickory Ground, at New Orleans, at Horse
Shoe Bend, and at Pensacola. The presence
of some of them here tc=lay is a living rebuke
to this land.”

Addressing the large crowd of white citi-
zens present, Mr. Day  said:—‘We can be,
as we always been faithful subjects, powerful
allies, as the documents read here to-day
prove ; an enemy in your midst, we would
be more powerful still. We ask for liberty;
liberty here—liberty on the Chalmette Plains
—liberty'wherever floats the American flag.
We demand for the sons of the men who
fought for you, equal privileges. We bring
to you, to-day, the tears of our fathers,—each
tear isa volume, and speaks to you. To
you, then, we appeal. We point you to
their blood, sprinkled upon your door-posts
in your political midnight, that the Yestroy-
ing Angel might pass over. We take you
to their sepulchres, to see the bond of honor
between you and them kept, on their part,
faithfully, even until death.”

‘he following extracts from an address de-
livered, in 1842, before the Congregational
and Presbyterian Anti-Slavery Society, at
Prancestown, N. I., by Dr. Harris, a Rev-
olutionary veteran, will be-read with great
interest ;—

« T sympathize deeply,” said Dr. Harris,
“in the objects of this Society. I fought,
my hearers, for the liberty which you enjoy.
Tt surprises me that every man does not ral-
ly at the sound of liberty, and array himself
with those who are laboring to abolish slavery
in our country. ‘The very mention of it
warms the blood in my veins, and,-old as T
am, makes me feel something of the spirit and
impulses of 776. :

es, slavery would not continue a year.
Nu, you would then go and abolish it with
the sword, if it were not speedily done
withgut. But is it a suitable cause for
making men slaves, because God has given
them such acolor, such hair and such features,
as he saw fit?”

LETTER FROM 5, R. WALKER.

At Revnen CLARK’s,‘
Near CaRTHAGENA, Mercer Co., Ohio,
December 3, 186].

Correspondence of The Pine and Palm.

Mr. Redpath—Dear Sir: 1 sit down to
write you a few items in regard to the early
settlement and origin of this place, &c.
From all that I can learn of old settlers, this
colony was settled or founded, in 1837, by
that great benefactor of the colored race,
Augustus Watles, who labored in his day
to clevate the colored people and place them
in an independent position as free men and
women, just as Haytian emigrationists are do-
ing now. Many ignorant persons opposed
Mr. Watles’ plan, but_ the rising generation
are doing justice to Mr. Watles’ memory.
So it will be with the men now acting in
this gréat enterprise. The emigration move-
ment will be an epoch in the history of the
colored American race.

As I entered this farfamed Mercer
settlement from the North, my knapsack
on my back, I met many dark faces, some
on horseback, and others with teams,
going to Celina, the county seat, to pay
tax, As I neared the town I came to
three men of unmistakable African descent
building a bridge. I was kindly invited to
stop and rest, which invitation I accepted.
After a moment’s conversation, they sur
mised that I was the person who was to aa-
dress the people of the town that night.
These three gentlemen,—H. Hurd, W.
Kendall, and Mr. Wright, —were substantial
well-to-do farmers, who, true to the instincts
of their race, extended their hospitalitics,
which I gratefully accepted ; taking tea with
Mr. Hurd, and lodging with Mr. Wright.
This place contains many beautiful farms,
with large and well-finished houses, belonging
mostly to colored people. As I entered the
post office I saw the room full of young
farmers, calling for their letters, and other
mail matters. ,

This settlement contains five churches,—
two Baptist, two Wesleyan Methodist, and
an A. M. E. Chureh—five school districts,
numbering from 40 up to as high as 75
scholars.

This upper settlement has one district and
one church. I have held three meetings here,
and as our friends say, with fine success ;
thirty were present the first night, many of °
them the heads of large families. Mr. R.
Clark’s family consists of 9 persons ; Mr.
E. Durant’s of 10; Mr. B. Durant’# of 8
persons. These men are of the bone and
sinew of the place, being rich farmers and
having outgrown the shackles their fathers
wore, are becoming restive, and asking
themselves the question, ‘What shall they do
to place their children beyond the over:
shadowing influences of American slavery?
Yours, &e., B. R. Waker.

—Day, panting with heat, and laden with
a thousand cares, toils onward like a beast
of burden; but Night—is a ministering an-
gel that cools with its dewy breath the toil
heated brow ; and, like the Roman sisterhood,

This country-has the general appellation of
the -fTowssa States, and contains several small
and tributary kingdoms or provinees, as Gan-
do, Sockotu, Katsena.

Janoes of all sizes are ready to transport
you and your effects across the river‘at Say. |
But if your luggage is very bulky, you must
haye one of the larger sort. ‘Such a boat is |
about forty feet in length, and‘four to five!
feet in width in the middlé; formed of two!
hollowed trunks of trees sewn together in the
centre. It twill carry three camels. The!
strcam is here contracted by a rocky hank,
and is only about 700 yards broad, but has
a noble appearance.

The main route from this place eastward is
pretty much frequented; andthe road is va-!
ried, being by turns rocky, woody, and swam- |
py. The people are poor, and the village :
and towns of no particular interest. But;
here is a salt-hamlet, of which there are sev- |
eral in this locality! It adjoins a large |
mound of rubbish about 200 yards square, |
and from 20 to 50 in height, formed of the ,
mould of the valley from which the saline!
particles have been extracted. The carth of |
the salt vale is put into large funnels made |
of straw and reeds ; so that when water is
poured ‘upon the carth, it is strained through
the funnels. Being ‘received into vessels
placed underneath, it is boiled, and the sedi-
ment is foried into small loaves of salt. The
product is of a greyish yellow color, and of
tolerable quality, especially for culinary pur-
The natives also extract salt from the

Sheik who he was? He answered with great
composure, ‘Ihe executioner.’ I ‘instant-
ly ordered my seryants to turn him out. ‘Be
patiént,’ said Sidi Sheik, laying his hand on
mine, ‘he visits the first people in Socketu,
and'they never allow lim to go away without
giving him a few goora nuts, or moncy to
buy them.’ “Tn compliance with this hint, I
requested forty cowries to be given to the
fellow, with striet orders never again to cross
my threshold.” This villain had applied to
the governor for the office of executioner,
which his own brother then held, boasting of
his superior adroitness in the family vocation,
The governor said, “We will try;—go fetch
your brother’s head.” The wretch immedi-
ately went to his brother’s house, and find-
ing him quictly sitting in the doorway, struck
off his head at one blow with a sword, giv-
ing him no warning whatever of his mission.
He carried the bleeding trophy to the gover-
nor, and claimed the promised office, which
was given to him. We has had plenty of
work to do, ‘The capital punishments inflict-
ed in Sudan are beheading, impaling, and
crucifixion ; the first being inflicted on Ma-
hometans, the two latter on pagans. Wretches
linger on the cross for a period of three
days, before death terminates their sufferings.

During Clapperton’s stay in Sockotu, pro-
visions were regularly sent him from the sul-
tan’s table on pewter dishes, with the London
stamp ; and one day, meat was served to
him ina white wash-hand basin of English
manufacture.

ferocious. It has searec., any mane, and
differs in this respect from the lion of central
Africa, whose mane is large and beautiful.
These wild beasts hunt in companies of foar
and five, and will not hesitate to steal a
camel.

‘he people of the desert dwell in small
villages of huts, built of mats attached to
stalks of corn or to young trees, and roofed
with branches covered with hides. They
subsist chiefly by cattle breeding, hunting,
stealing, and convoying caravans, ‘Their
manners are very free, aud the morals of beth
sexes are described as extremely loose.

The naturalist could find some objects of
interest in the desert. There is a plaut,
ealled in Howssa “tkumkuninia,”’ a species
of euphorbia, which grows to the height of
nearly two feet. It is yery poisonous, and
is ured to anoint the tips of ‘arrows. ‘Then
there is the ‘‘aido,”’ a grass ‘covered with
large and strong prickles, very distressing to
naked feet. One part of the country is
nearly covered with the Ascleptas gigantea,
on the leaves of which the cattle fied. It
has a milky juice (used by pagans to foment
their ‘giya,”’) which spots clothes, and even |
injures the hair of horses. Acacias, dwarf
laurels, and other stunted plants grow in the
more fertile places.

Now suppose that we could be transported
across this desert region, which we gladly
leave to its present oceupants, and that we
could be set down in Agades itself. This
once far-fumed city deserves a little notice.

distressing. ‘he caravan lost’ many camels
through fatigue ; and they often passed nu-
merous skeletons of unhappy persons, chiefly
slaves, who had died of exhaustion on their
way to Tripoli. Near one well they counted
more than a hundred, some of which had the
skin still attached to the bones. During a
day’s journey of twenty-six miles, they passed
107 of these skeletons. No wonder! ‘The
poor slaves are marched with chains round
their legs and necks, with a scanty supply of
provision, and with no warm clothing. Their
privations, therefore, must he great; for the
traveller says, ‘it was the eighth day since
our camels had ‘tasted water,—and_ at ‘niight
it, blew a hurricane.” Again he writes,
‘During the last two days, we had passed
on an average trom:sixty to eighty or ninety
skeletons each day; but the numbers that
lay about the wells at El Hammar were
countless ; those of two women, whose per-
fect and regular teeth bespoke them young,
were particularly shocking. ‘Their arms still
remained clasped round each other, as they
had expired ; although the flesh bad long
since perished, by being exposed to the burn-
ing rays of tho sun, and the blackened hones
only were left. ‘The nails of the fingers, and
some of the sinews of the hand, also. remain-

still appeared through the teeth. We had
now passed six days of desert, without the

Herc is a specimen. A merchant of Tripoli,
travelling in the caravan, has been suffering
on the road from an enlarged spleen. He
is advised to undergo the operation of burn-
ing with ‘a red-hot ifon; which the Arabs
think an unfailing remédy for most internal
disorders. He consents. - They lay him’
down ou his back in the sand, where five or
six men hold him steady. ‘The rude surgeons
commence their work by burning him in
thre@places under the ribs of the left side ;
each wound being of the size of a sixpence.
Whilst the iron is again heating, a number of
thumbs are pressed into his side, to know if
he feels pains ; and their rough pressure is
so great, that the sick man declares he feels
pain allover, The operators then make four
more brands near the former ones ; then turn
ing him over, they make three larger near his
back bone. Finally, an old Arab, who has
been feeling his throat, declares that he re-
quires a large burn near the collar bone.
‘The patient submits to this savage treatnient
with admirable patience, and getting up,
drinks a large‘draught of water, and remounts
his camel for the journey. We should think
that this mangling must cither end or mend
the sufferer.

Wild and lawless are these children of the
desert. The escort of a caravan think them-
selves privileged to lay hold of any thing or
any body which comes in their way, and to
help themselves to whatever they need.
When any of the camels die of fatigue, they
try to replace them without money. When

ble to the feverish excitement created, or ag-
gravated by this thoughtless course of the
Press, in its assumption of being over-wise ;
and much is chargeable to the interested self
ishness of stock-jobbers and others, who are
endeavoring “to turn a penny” hy ereating a
business confusion. Some of the papers have
declared that Mason and Slidell have been
hung—that a man-of-war has started, or soon
will be sent to carry Lord Lyous home—that
the British Ministry will declare war imme-
diately, without asking or awaiting explana: °
tions—that the British Government has de-
manded an apology, and granted our Gov-
ernment twenty-four hours within which to
make it. In fact, they teem with thousands
of as idle and incredible stories.

We rejoice at knowing that an end is about
being put to this exciting and profitless gos
sip.

On Saturday, intelligence was received
from Washington, that Government had yicld-
ed to the demands of England, and Mason
and Slidell would be given up. lowever
mortifying this may be te our pride, with
howsoever little propriety or consistency Eng-
land can make such a demand, bearing in
mind the extreme position by her taken, and
persistently maintained, through a long term
of years, in somewhat similar cases, her own
self-interest and selfishness being uppermost,
we think under existing circumstances, the
decision arrived at by our Government is the
wisest and most politic. If the principle in-
volved is recognized and honestly abided by,
in the future, on the part of Great Britain,
civilized nations in general will have cause
for gratulation at the recent occurrences,
which may lead or require her, relens rolens,
to sanction the doctrine in regard to neutral
rights, long advocated and contended for by
this country, and more recently by France.
The. National Intelligencer, in commenting
on the decision arrived at, says :-—

“Whatever may he the disappointment, if
any, at the result to which the administration

that ‘Territory. We trust that all such
claims as may be presented will be thoroughly
examined and rigidly scrutinized. There is
agreat deal of iniquity connected with this
class of claims; a great deal of imposition
and fraud practised by the holders of them.
If one half what we hear le true, the New

ception to, exhibits a glaring instance of,

the Territorial officials will prove themselves
clear of all complicity with any of the actors,

We see that Gov. Connelly, who was, at
one tine, thought to be Secessionally inclined,
and was most assuredly Pro-Slavery in his
proclivitics, intends exercising his inuence
to induce the Legislature of New Mexico to
repeal its slave code. ‘This may be from an
honest convietion of its injustice ; but as he
was one of the prime nvovers in getting it en-
acted, and as his former nomination te the
oflice he oceupies was, at the special session
of Congress, rejected by’ the Senate from
want of confidence in the naan, and as his re-
nomination, (through delegate Watts’s in-
fluence with the President,) is pending in
the Senate for confirma‘i-~> rn second re-

As there is seldom an evil without some
compensating good, we aro glad to find that
these outrages, and similar apprehended ones,
have aroused Gen. Halleck to institute more
stringent measures against lawless depredz-
tors. Ife has issued an order to the effect that
bridge-burners, and railroad and telegraph
destroyers, if caught, will be shot immeiliate-
ly; any one charged with these crimes will
be tried, and if pronounced guilty, be exe-
cuted ; the commanding officer of the post
uearest to the place where the damage isdone,
will cause the necessary repairs to be made,
employing for the purposo the property and
slaves of the neighboring Secessionists, and
the Secessionists themselves, if need be;
pretended Unionists withholding information
of the acts or actors, will be deemed aiders
and abettors, and proceeded against accord-
ingly ; towns and counties within which the
destruction takes place, will be held respon-
sible therefor, unless satisfactory proof be
adduced that the people were too weak to
successfully resist the action of the trespassers.

This order, if promptly and faithfully en-
forced, will soon work a reformation in that
section which has long been urgently needed,
and which can never be accomplished by any

those qualities which are a sine qua non to
the development of the entire man. It is
said that he is deficient in judgment, in fore-
thought, in the ability to plan and to exe-
cute, and that, left to himself, thrown uppn
his own resources and responsibilities, he will,
sooner or later, relapse into barbarism.
Our maligners roll these premises as a
sweet morsel under their veracious(?) tongues,
and jump with all the dexterity of the most
accomplished acrobat, to the conclusion that
those who insist upon having us treated, in
all respects, as men, are practising a philoso-
phy in direct hostility to the Divine economy,
and forcing us into an uncongenial clement,
one for which we have no natural adaptation,
and in which we must inevitably wither, droop,
and die.
But the facts, the facts! What are the
facts? Vor facts, stubborn and immutable,
are worth more than theories, unless the latter
are supported by the former.
It is safe to affirm that the human race is
a unit—that man is the same in all ages.
He may differ in certain phenomenal aspects,
under the modifying play of certain circum: ;
stances; but in no respect are the laws of’
his being altered or annulled. One speci-
men of a fully developed negro, a pure ne-
gro, (none of your half-and-half arrange-
ments, ) is sufficient to prove the title of the
whole race to equal rights as men. It will
not do to argue that such a negro is an ex-
ception, and proves nothing. The most learn-
ed monkey cannot make a mathematician,
nor can the wisest and most wonderful ele-
phant be taught to build a steamboat, or to
command an army. No such exceptions can
be found among the race, for the simple
reason that they do not, and cannot, exist.
But we have it in our power to ‘proudly
point out instances among negroes, as de-
monstrations of the absurdity of the domina of
our inherent inferiority, and our inability to
take care of ourselves. Whatever the white
man has done, the black man has done.
Whatever the white man can do, the black
man ean do. We have among us farmers

Gen. Pope, on the 18th ult., made a
forced march against the rebels, 2200 strong,
in Clinton and Henry counties, Mo; where-
upon the latter beat a precipitate retreat
towards Rose Hill, Johnson county ; leaving
behind, their arms, baggage, munitions, pa-
pers, Xc., all of which were seized by Gen.
Pope, who still continued in pursuit of the
enemy, as far as Johnson, Bates county,
where they scattered in all directions, the
main portion flecing south. Gen. Pope
again pushed on to within 15 miles of Osce-
ola, (where Price has 8000 troops,) and
captured 150 rebels, with all their baggave,
stores, &c. Additional squads taken, aug.
mented the number of prisoners to 800.

On the evening of the 18th ult., another
portion of Gen. Pope's force, under the com-
mand of Col. Davis, surprised a sceond rebel
camp, near Milford, Mo., and took the whole,
1500 strong, prisoners; among them were
one Lieut-Colonel, two Colonels, and 17 Cap-
tains ; at the same time were captured, 1000
stand of arms, 1000 horses, 65 wagons, and
a large quantity of baggage, tents, and sup-
plies. The Unionists lost two killed and
eight wounded; the rebel logs was not ascer-
tained.

Near Glasgow, Mo., two tons of gunpow-
der have been secured, which were found
cachéd (or buried) on Claib. Jackson’s farm.
By later Missouri intelligence, the gencral
summing up of our recent successes, shows
as follows; viz: the capture of 2500 rebels,
izluding 70 commissioned officers; 1200
horses £1 moles ; 1100 stand of arms ; 100
negroes; I? tons of gunpowder, and a vast
amount of camp equipage and commissary

We have carefully perused the correspon-
dence between the United States and British
Governments, growing out of Capt. Wilkes’s
procedure in the Mason Slidell capture. ‘The
Sceretary of State has argued the case aini-
rably, perhaps justly, for Great Britain ;
stating, however, that the doctrine advocated
is sound American doctrine, which has been
maintained and contended for by the Cnited
States, for more than half a century. We
had supposed that some great principle, which
Fugland, heretofore, has not acknowledged,
was now about being recognized, and firmly
established.

But, if we read aright, in this, we are mis-
taken, and the decision arrived at does little
more than dispose of this isolated case; the
great question, so long pending,
the nature and extent of neutral rights in

relative to

peace as well as in war, stil remaining un-
settled unless by implication. Mr,

which he determines in our favor, and the
fifth against us, thereby vitiating the whole

since, the Mexiean people were loyal to a

to afew heartless politicians ; but now dis-
satisfaction and distrust are spreading fay

We are constantly being told, (and
thereby cajoled,) hy one official after anoth-
er, week following week, that this is to be a
short war, So in substance, if not actual
phraseology, has said the Sceretary of War,
the Seeretary of State, the recognized Com-
mander-in-ehief, and the President himself.
“One has confidently declared that the troops
would be enabled to join in the Christmas
gambols at home ; another, that they would
there participate in the joyous greetings of
the incoming year; another that the end
would certainly be prior to the rigors of win-
ter setting in, [t has been oracularly an-
nounced, that astounding events would be
mado manifest within a given time, already
past, said events still remaining undeveloped;
and it has also been in a seer-like manner

predicted, that tho rebellion would be erushed
out utterly and forever, in’ the space of so
many designated days. ‘The present. con-
dition and aspect of affhirs leads us ine the
language of other times to give the warning
ery, ‘Beware of false prophets.”

{t is not, however, my intention to dis-

to which T have adverted, but to call atten-

incorreetness. Such a demonstration we
have in the establishment, growth, and pres-
ent condition of a settlement of fugitive slaves
in the township of Buxton, GC. W., a settle-
ment coneerning which much has been said
and written. Tet us look at the naked, un-
varnished faets, and let us reflect that the
persons who compose this settlement are refu-

it’s time is short.
This settlement was formed in 18-9, for
the purpose of providing colored persons in
Canada with homes. It was incorporated by
Act of Parliament in 1850. It contains
about eighteen square miles of country, in
the township of Buxton, and County of ent,
Canada West. ‘The land was purchased
from the Government, by Rey. Wm. King
of Louisiana, (formerly a slaveholder,) at a
coxt of SL8,000. It is divided into farms
of fifty aeres each, with a road. sixty-six feet
wide, running past each firm. ‘The houses,
which are mostly built of round or hewed
logs, ave set ata short distance from the road,
with a prass plat in front, and the garden and
yard enclosed with a neat and substantial
fence. Some of tho early settlers have good
frame houses, well furnished. Most of them
are whitewashed, and covered partly withthe
grape vine. ‘This gives to the dwellings a
neat and beautiful appearance. ‘The settlers
have cleared from ten to thirty aeres of land,
built their houses, and provided their own
farming implements, without “taking the hat
around.’’ Some whom [ visited farm 100,
and some 150 acres. Their farms are as well
cultivated as any I saw in the West. Some

LETTER FROM E. R. WALKER.

At ReEcBEN CLARR’s,:
NEAR CaRTNAGENA, Mercer Co., Ohio, }
December 3, 186].
Correspondence of The Pine and Palm.

Mr, Redpath—Dear Sir: T sit down to
write you a few items in regard to the early
settlement and origin of this place, Ke.
From all that I can learn of old settlers, this
colony was settled or founded, in 1837, by
that great benefactor of the colored race,
Augustus Watles, who labored in his day
to elevate the colored people and place them
in an independent position as free men and
women, just as THaytian emigrationists are do-
ing now. Many ignorant persons opposed
Mr, Watles’ plan, but the rising generation
are doing justice to Mr. Watles” memory.
So it will be with the men now acting in
this gréat enterprise. The emigration move-
ment will be an epoch in tho history of the
colored American race.

As U entered this  farfamed Mercer
settlement from the North, my knapsack
on my back, I met many dark faces, some
on horseback, and others with — teams,
going to Celina, the county seat, to pay
tux. As I neared the town I eame to
three men of unmistakable African descent
building a bridge. I was kindly invited to
stop and rest, which invitation I accepted.
After a moment's conversation, they sur
mised that T was the person who was to aa-
dress the people of the town that night.
These three gentlemen,—H. Hurd, W.
Kendall, and Mr. Wright,—were substantial
well-to-do farmers, who, true to the instincts
of their race, extended their hospitalitics,
which T gratefully accepted ; taking tea with

Mr. Turd, and lodging with Mr. Wright.
This place contains many beautiful farms,
with Jarge and well-finished houses, belonging
mostly to colored people. mM

farmers, calling for their letters, and other

Autumn Arrangements.

Arrangements will be male by which emigrants
can sail from different ports during theautumn and :
winter, Due notice will be piven of the days of '
sailing, through the columns of The Pine and Palm.

Persons desiring to emigrate are requested to |
react carefally the circulars of this Bureau, and to
tullow the directions therein given, a3 it is impossi-
Mle to provide for the comfort of passengers except
by insisting on a strict compliance with our regu-
lations.

I, Let it be understood, that all whocan pay for
their passage are expected to dos05 and thata
passage willbe advanced to such farmers and Ja-
borers only as are unable to meet this expense.

I. All mechanics who intend to praciice their
trades in Hayti, must go at theirown expense 3 the
Government: guarantees to find work for farmers
and laborers only. It will weleome all colored eme
igrants ; butit cannot agree to provide work for
all classes of mechanics, [ts demand for agricul-
tural labor is unlimited ; but tor mechanical skill
this is not the case.

IN. Passengers will be charged at the rate of
$18 cach adult from United States ports; from
Canada West, $25. Children under cight will be
charged half price ; infants under one ycar, free.

IV. Passengers, in all cases, must provide their
own bedding, Mattresses mast be four feet wide.
Each passenger must also be provided with a cin
gallon can for tater, atin cup, atin p knitu and
fork, a few pounds of soap, and iowels, with such
extra utensils as may be deemed necessury to hold
the daily rations. .

*. ‘The amount of baggage allowel to every
passenger is two tanks, er two barrels, or one
trunk andone barrel. All treight over that amount
will he charged for, separately from the passave
ticket, at the rate af 75 cents per barrel cr i5 cents
per cubic foot from American ports. The amount
for all overlund freight, when advance’ by the
Bureau, will Le added to the passaze money in the
Contract, This is exclusive of the bedding,—which
gos free. All goods inst be boxed up.

Emigrants are at liberty to carry, free of expense,
additional provisions to be used on the voyage.
Slight additions may be made to the navy rations;
but the Burean does not pledge itself to do so.

VIL. As efforts have been industriously made by
unscrupulous men to misrepresent the conditions
under which emigrants who do not prepay their pes-
saves, will accept the offers of the Government of
Hayti, ic is deemed advisable to publish below,
in full, the contract to be made with them. The
words in italie and within brackets (blank in the
original) are tilled up to show precisely the terms
on which a single man can emigrate. It should
be distinetly understood, that no bartier whatever
will be put to any man’s return, excepting that he
shall pay the sum of cighteen dollars before em-
barking for the United States, if he aid not pay
for his own passage from this country to Hayti.
The Government of Hayti, while they will welcome
all visitors, cannot reasonably be expeeted to pay
their passages, Hence this provision.

The tollowing is the contract with the emigrants
who do not prepay their passages;

Your fate, your social position, instead of amelior-

With us in that country in which, nevertheless they

for the free, who. believed that .they had now po
liasicrs; it is this humiliating patronage which is
revoltiny to your hearts. Philanthropy, in spite of
its noble efturts, seems more powerless than ever
to lead your cause to yictory. Contemptand hatred
increase avainst you, and the people of the United
States desire to cject you from its bosom.

Coinc, then, to us! the doors of Hayti are open
toyou, By happy coincidence, which Providence
seems to have brought about in your behalf, Hayti
has risen from the Jong debasement in which a

such generous efforts to break the chains of those
of our brethren who are still in slavery.

Our institdtions are liberal. The government is

tivated, which only need intelligent workmen to

The poorer emizrants shall have the right to all
thet their siiuativa demands. The Government
will provide for their first necessities, and will take
the proper measures to secure to them a quiet and
honorable asylum, as well as to facilitate for them
the means of obtaining employment.

hallin which its sessions were held: “Saint Do-
MINGO, Tht Law, aNp THe Kine.”

Its acts are its decrees, whose promulzation and
exceution are confided to the Provincial Assem-
blies and committees.

Ik devlares that the Commandant of Mirbalais
has acted rightly in refusing to take the civic oath,
or to adminisier it to the soldiery, because -olidieal
reaons forbid it.—[Siuting of April 14.)

On the ith of April it learns that owo hundred
and eizhty reeruits, sent out by the minister, have ;
deen landed at Port-au-Prince; it commands that
they be neémbarked for France within eight days;
“bestuse,” said the decree, Cit would be very dan-
gercus to aliow such men to disseminate the pois-
onoas Coctrines of the philanthropic sect, through.
out the Colony.” A few days after, at the instance
of the Governor, it counterinands the execution of
said order, at the same time declaring that it fully
entertains the opinions which had influenced its
action.

At the same on of Aprill7,a member makes
@ motion that the Saict Domingo deputies be in- !

wren Thay ti, durlig the drat alx inonthe of dhe
nesent year. Tn thatardele, whieh occupied near
¥ tive colons of The Ping and Palin, we showed
hat the ex ports from Boston tothe ports of Uaytl,
anbraced: nearly every artlele prodaced ino the
vilted States; and dhatthe Claytlans are among
he very best cistomers which that port posscascs.
Vhe mere enumeration of those ex ports ran throwgh
neavly every letter of the alphabet, and occupied
Uaee and a ball columns of closely printed nat.
ter. Extensive, however, aa those facts proved the
commerce of Boston and Laytl to be, they showed
nerely a fractional partol the commercial dealings
between the two couutries. Between New York,
Philadelphia, and Baldinore, a geent trade Is also
carricd on; und up to the establishment of the
blockade, it was extended to New Orleans, Wil-
nington, N, C., and one or two other ports on the
Southern coast.

For tho fase fiscal year ending: June 30, 1860,
the exports to) Hayti from the United States,
amounted to $2, 678,682, and our imports from that
country amounted to $2,062,7235 nud itis believed
that when the next fiscal returns are published they
willshow a very decided increase over those ae
counts,

tcis interesting to glance over the returns which
we publish, if for no other purpose than te observe
what remarkably varied demands Hayti inakes
upon the manufacturing and industrial resources of
the Cnited States. Our exports to other countries
nay be much more valuable and much more ex-
tensive, but we question if they include such @ very
marked diversity, in nearly every kind of article
produced or manufactured in this country. As
will be seen, the chief exports are Immoer, lard, but-
ter, codfish, cheese, flour, soap, pork, dried fish,
hams, rice and tobacco. Of lard, the quantity ¢x-
ported was nearly a quarter of a inillion Ibs.; of
codfish, there were nearly 6100 quintals; of cheese,
upwards of 24,000 Ibs.; of flour, nearly 23,000 bar-
rels; of soup, nearly 25,000 boxes; of hams, 16,000
coat cates : Ibs.; of dried tish, nearly 12,000 boxes; of vice,
varied wridags from and about the colored race as 2,900 barrels and 246 derces; and of tobacco, 1,500
bates, in addition tu 1,592 Ibs. of the manufactured
article,

These shipments were conveyed in both Atneri-

for the gold-washing in one of the stcuons most:
abounding in this metal. The expenditures neces ;
sary for the prosecution of these researches having
exceeded the amount placed at the disposal or the!
cominittee, the surplus has been advanced by
Mesors. Wright, Green and Hendriks; which ad-
vances, and the sums entrusted to the comusnittes, |
amount to £4000. The commitice hope that this
sum will not appear extravagant when the work
to be accomplished is considered, ;

It is now proposed to form a company for the i

ft waa impossible to have evaded the subject
with more hanzhtiness and impudence, ‘

by aceeree bearing date April 17, also, the A3-
sermbis of Saint Mark, following out the strange
ilea thay private communications are doubtless in-
Vielable, but that the correspondence of the ad- |
ministrators could nor be inelasted in the category

of April, following the example of the National As-

clare the persons of its members inviolable; ap-

pointed a Cornmittee on Reports, on Laws, on
Commerce, on Finance, on Agricaliace, and on

The enactment of this deerce 34 only the artien-
late reproduction of the principles laid down in the
preamble,

ft is said that Daney and Larchevesque-Thiband
were its principal authors: this would prove that
these two men were ag able as they were danger
ons it will be renembercd that both were lawyers,
the one Attorney-General, and the other Counselor
to the Superior Couneit of the Cape.

This decree was, in reaticy, a declaration of inde-
pendence, Without throwing off the mask entirely,
amd raising the standard of revalt, the Assembly of
Saint) Mark contd not more expressly antonnice
that the Colony of Saint Domingo was a State ine
dependent of France, subject to the same Ring,

obut having the sole right to make and administer

its own Jaws. The subsequent regulation of the
ordinary relations between the two conntries, de

paceeptance by the National Asseobly and the

King's sanction were, itis true, reserved, Bution
the first point, it was understood that it should be
rented by the contracting parties on a footing of
equality, and with regard to any feeds arrange:
tnents and on the other two points, the reservation
was nade in such away as to indicate that the
want of acceptance or sanction would not prevent
the carrying ont of these pretended constitutional
bases,

In the opinion of the Assembly, the decree onght
to be considered as definitive; the National Asser.

“bly being wnable to reject it without violating its

own principles,

The Assembly of Saint Mark received from the
Assembly of the North, on the 26th of April, the
28th Mareh. Conn
Peinier, 9 few days after, officially notified the As-

of

serobly of them; yet they were not entercd upon

the minutes until the first of Jnne--doubtless to

inake it appear that the Assembly was not aware of
these two decrees until after it had adopted that of
its constitutional bases.

is the way in which the Colonial legislators, not
having the ability boldly to take possession of

THE MINERAL WEALTH OF HAYTI

BY DROW. G. SMITH, OF PORT-AU-PRINCE,

VIEE--Ctoa L- (conenupen.)
Translated expressly for The Pine and Pah.

Report of the Board of. Diveetors of the compa:
ny for working Che mines of Hayti in isis,

The conunittee begs leave to state that shortly
after the appearance of the prospects rider whose
direction the company was formed, it found itself
obliged to abandon the part relative to agriculaire,
The existing liws in Uayti presented obstacles of
steel a nature thacit was deemed prudent not to
oppose them. Tn regard to other, parts of this
prospectus, concerning the mines of copper and
the melting of gold, the company has emploved
eminent and eapable persons toexanine the dider-
ent mines and rivers where polis found, and at
the same time to) procure official information ve.
sulting from observations and practical researches,
By so doing, the committee has discharged the da.
ties Imposed Upon it, and ava elt of our col-
tins, tomatke an exhibit of its (ansactions to the
stockholders.

The reports an the copper mines are very favor:
able, aecompanied by maps aud plans of the places
where they are situated; by which it appears that

On the 4th inst... near Haneoek, Mad.,
GOOO rebels attacked the 5th Connceticut
Reginent, occupied in protecting the railroad.
After a slight skirmish, the Unionists were
compelled to retire, and await reinforeements.
1n the meanwhile, the enemy destroyed the
telegraph lines and railroad, thus interrupt.
ing communication with Cumberland. Sub-
sequently, Gen. Lander was sent to the res-
cue, and still later, other troops were des-
patched, and more were getting in readiness.
The rebels under Gen. Jackson appeared
opposite Hancock, and attempted to enforce
a threat to shell out our troops. They  re-
tired, however, on the night of the 6th, hav-
ing accomplished little by the shelling; the
force consisted of 10 regiments, furnished
with a large baggage and supply train, and
10 days’ cooked rations.

On the {th inst., the Unionists, about 700
in number, sent out by Gen. Milory, at-
tacked the rebels about 800 strong, at Hun-
tersville, Va., drove them away without
losing a man, and captured $80,000 worth
of military stores and clothing, which were
destroyed. The rebel loss amounted to 80
killed and wounded.

On the Ist inst., Commodore Dupont
landed 3500 troops near the Port Royal fer-
ry, and in an engagement, was repulsed by
the enemy. On the following day, in a sec-
ond engagement, the Unionists were success-
ful, and the South Carolinians under Gen.
Gregy were driven back with heavy loss.

The steamer Vanderbilt, at New York
fron Port Royal, on the 8d inst., (with
3679 bales of cotton,) brings intelligence
that Gen. Stevens advanced on the main land
the Ist inst., and captured the rebel batteries,
after a short resistance; he then advanced to
within six miles of the Charleston Ruilroad.
Aimong our wounded (eight in manber) is
Major Watson of the 8th Michigan, mortally.
The rebel fortifications are seid to be very
extensive, and defended by 11.000 or 12,-
G00 men, under Gen. Pope. Gen Stevens
maintains possession of his ground, and is
awatling reiaforcements from the North !

Three divisions of the Potumae troops have
heen ordered to Aunapolis, for purposes
known only to the Departiacut, and—proba-
bly the enemy.

from Leavenworth, Mansas, under date of
the dth ingt., comes intelligence of a battle
in the Cherokee country, between the Union-
ist Indians, and the rebel ‘Texans and half
breeds, resulting in the death of the Texan
Gen, Cooper, and Mefntosh, the leader of
the half-breeds.

Sprcmmes of THE MANNER OF GETTING UP
Truranspnic axp NEWSPAPORIAL SENSATION
Ivems.—Under the head of the Latest In-
telligenco by ‘Telegraph, is conspicuously
displayed, in large letters, usually in’ capi
tals, something like the following—viz :
“Discovery of the Source of Rebel Informa-
After a
diligent search through a crowded column of
the news items, the anxious seeker finds the
following astounding particulars, which throw
a flood of darkness upon the whole matter :

tien af our Army Afovements.”

“It is said that circumstances have traus-
pired, within the past few days, leading to
the belief that it will not be difficult to des-
ignate with certainty the source whence the
rebels have, within the last two months, de-
rived most valuable information, which it is
known the Government took every means to
conceal.”

A second detachment of troops, be-
longing to Gen. Butler’s Division, embarked
on board the steamship Constitution, at Bos-
ton, on Thursday last; it is composed of two
regiments of Infantry, and a squadron of
Cavalry—viz: 12th Maine Regiment, Col.
Shepley, the Bay State Regiment, Col.
French, Captain Read’s Mounted Rangers,
and the Artillery Company from Maine. The
ship has hauled out in the stream, and it is
yet uncertain when she will take her depart-
ure. General Butler will remain until the
Third Division is ready to leave ; after which,
we trust in due time, to hear a good report
of their doings.

-—— It has been 2 matter of some won-
derment, why Gen. Viele abandoned his pro-
jected expedition. Recent advices from
Port Royal furnish as a reason an unfortu-
nate disagreement between Gen. Sherman
and Commodore Dupont.

The double-headed system, it would seem,
works no better in the military, than in the
educational ranks. Considering the large ex-
perience that has been had this way, under
both the single and double-headed systems,
we think ourofficers, civiland military, might
learn some useful lessons from the ‘Teachers
and School Committeemen of the goodly
City of Boston. §

The attention of Government has
heen directed by Gen. Banks to Southern
INinois asa fine field for cotton raising. It is
said there are, in that State, from 5,000,000
to 10,000,000 of acres admirably adapted
for the purpose, capable of yielding from 300
to 500 pounds per acre; and that at one

tine almost the entire population was engaged
in the culture. ‘The cotton produced there
corresponds in’ quality and staple to that of
‘Tennessee.

THE EXPEDITION AGAINST MEXICO.

The Albionic-Gallie-Hispaniolie Expe-
dition, which has so long been threatening
impoverished, degraded Mexico, hag at length

commenced active operations. The Spanish
the allied
Havana on the 2d, reached Vera Cruz on
the Sth, and took posession of the city on the
L5th ult., without meeting with the least re-
sistance.

The Spanish Commander, Don Manuel
Gassett, on demanding a surrender, was in-
formed by Gov Uraga, that he had that very
morning, by order of the Mexican Govern-
ment, issued a proclamation for the evacua-
tion of the city and forts, and consequently
that the Spanish troops would encounter no
opposition. Commander Gassett issued an
address to the people, full of fraternity and
goodwill, in the most approved fashion of the
times, copied after an antique model, labelled,

“Ts it well with thee my brother?”

Of course the true intent is that every
thing shall be conducted in a beeoming man-
ner for the advantage of Spain, though to
the disadvantage of Mexico, or for the disad-
vantage of Mexico, though to the advantage
of Spain ; at the option of the distracted Re-
public.

He declares that they have come on ‘no
inission of conquest, nor for interested mo-
tives.” He exhorts the Vera Cruzeans to
“fear nothing from the Spanish soldiers,”
and is confident, after fulfilling the mission
confided to it, the army will return home
“with the certainty of having merited your
affection.”

Commander Gassett also issued an ad-
dress to his soldiers, in which he alludes to
that crucl, bloodthirsty conqueror, Cortez,
““vho with a handful of Spaniards bore the
ensign, of the Cross and civilization, making
the world resound with
[horrid and brutal] deeds.” “Our mission
is fully as glorious. We come to command
satisfaction for insults offered to our flag,”
ke. Ke.

On the eve of disembarkation, the troops
saluted their commander with a song ; or as
it is stylad Aymn, yery properly, not on ac-
count of the saeredness of its character, but
from being a song of praise ; praise and adu-
lation to Spain, whom ‘no one shall insult
with impunity.” This effusion was com-
posed for the oceasion, and is thus translated
for the New York Evening Post :

CHORUS.

“EInste to the field of battle,
Litt up the warlike strain,
‘God save the Spanish kingdom!
We go to Aight for Spain,’

portion of fleet set sail froin

his marvellous

The Mexiean dominion
Broke off, in an evil hour,
With mad and impious rashness,
From Spain’s maternal power.
And ever since that moment
Has anarehy borne sway,
Nor over, on the region,
Has dawned one happy day.

Spain sees cho sieht of horrer,
And shuddering as she views,
Sho calls her valiant army
_ Po march on Vera Craz.
Now is the moment, soldiers,
To prove by gallant deeds
That victory ever follows
Wherv’or the Spaniant leads.”

LETTER FROM OHIO. .
Prava, 0., Dee. 2, 1851.

Editors of The Pine and Palm: Some
time since, | promised to let you know some-
thing further from this part of Ohio. Mr.
i. P. Walker of Toledo, held a most glori-
ous meeting in ony city, the 10th inst., on
the subject of Haytian Emigration. After
he had closed his able and cloquent address,
in behalf of the Movement, thirty-two persons
came forward and signed their names to the
club, Mr. Walker is a self-made man, and
is well adapted to the masses of colored peo-
ple; in fact, more so than many who are
more polished. He is all the people want,
a plain, practical, common-sense man, appa-
rently honest in all he says. He expects to
go out in the Spring, with a number of
others.

I am glad to say the feeling is growing in
favor of the Movement, and you may look
for quite a number at an early day from this
point. In order that mony of my friends
who are still opposed to the Movement, and
ask for further information from one of their
number who Aas been to Haytt, may be grati-
fied, I have decided to go out in the Spring,
with the intention of returning during the
next Summer, and giving my impressions of
the country, and judgment in favor of immi-
gration, or not. At present, LT have not the
least idea but that I will like the country,
especially its advantages for making money ;
for without money, we cannot be comfortable
in any country.

T am sorry to see there is so much opposi-
tion to Mr. Redpath’s paid agents; also
that there is opposition to Mr. Redpath
himself. Now I would ask any sensi-
ble man if he expects men to labor night
and day for a cause, without some remunera-
tion. For instance, Mr. Ek. P. Walker, of
Toledo, has been travelling for several weeks
leeturing day and night, without pay. And
‘be assured, he is working as earnestly as
those who get pay. But is it right ?

If Mr. Redpath has “paid agents,” it is
no more than right. We ought to feel grate-
ful that he has something for our learned men
to do, and money to pay them for their ser-
vices. I have no idea the sum paid is so
large as to induce men to sacrifice their prin-
ciples to obtain it. If this Movement is ad-
vantageous to the colored people, let us sup-
port the men engaged in it; if itis not, let
us discourage it with all our might. But to
determine that, we must make a thorough
investigation of the whole scheme, in all its
bearings. There are some of us who expect

_to go to Eayti for the purpose of making
money, as well as seeuring our liberties ; and
we expeet to heeome citizens. But if, at
at some future time, we should want to take
up our abode in some foreign land, we should
do so; for we consider anywhere upon God’s
foot-stool, it is our right to live, as much as
others; we eare not what their complexion.

But the ereat idea with us, in my judg-
iment, should be, for us to coneentrate some-
where, (as we have not, and [tear we never
will, in this eountry,) and why not let that
place be Hayti.

The inducements offered by that Govern-
ment, and its feilities are greater than those
of any other. We are doing nothing here.
Our learned men are confined to a few
branches of literary employments, and the
uniearned are contined to the menial work of
tho whites ; excepting those who aro owners
of farms, and are able to give themselves
employment. Wo want, and ought to have,
more than this ; our interests are ap, varied,
ae sheukl be, as theoo of any other er,

Woe have been hopetul of Mr. Predo\ek
Douglass’s making the trip to Hayti, Wind
ho intended dving last Spring, Wo regarw
his opinion of great importance. With his
world-wide reputation, ho would) go among
tho Haytians with moro prestige, which
would vive hint greater advantages than any
man we have in’ the country. — He would

THE APPAR AT OSSAWATONIB,

JUN UROWN to tN.

AS UARLAPER UY UArt. RUSE.

On the evening of Aug 20th, Lo passed
through the tewn ef Ossawatomio sac) the
Forry Timet my sou Fredevivk, who brought
mo news trom below. UL tad but a short ine
torviow, thinking to seo him again: seo. 1
learned bore that a company were advancing

ic

or blankets, and must have suffered had it
not been for a few wild berries, and, later,
the gift of a little corn meal and molasses,
from a poor Indian. May God bless him for
it. It was one of the best gifts I ever re-
ceived.

I was since told, by an officer of that
Company, that they carried off three wagon
loads of the dead from that engagement, and
about fiffy wounded. And, sir, if the whole
people of Ossawatomie had turned out, and
done their best, we should have routed them
entirely, and saved the town.

COLORED AMERICAN PATRIOTISM,
IL.

vised the Constitution of New York, in 1821,

speaking of the colored inhabitants of the

State, said :

“My honorable colleague has told us, that,

as the colored people are not required to con-

tribute to the protection or defence of the

State, they are not entitled to an equal par-

ticipation in the privileges of its citizens.

But, sir, whose fault is this? Have they

ever refused to do military duty when called

upon? It is haughtily asked, Who will

stand in the ranks shoulder to shoulder with

with a negro? I answer, No one, in time of
peace ; no one, when your musters and train-
ings are looked upon as mere pastimes; no
one, when your militia will shoulder their
muskets and march to their trainings with as
much unconcern as they would go to a
sumptuous entertainment or a splendid ball.
But, sir, when the hour of danger approaches,

your white ‘militia’ are just as willing that
the man of color should be set up as a mark
to be shot at by the enemy, as to be set up
themselves. In the war of the Revolution,
these people helped to fight your battles by
land and by sea. Some of your States were
glad to turn out corps of colored men, and to
stand ‘shoulder to shoulder’ with them.

In your late war they contributed largely

toward some of your most splendid victories.
On Lakes Erie and Champlain, where your
fleets triumphed over a foe superior in num-
bers and engines cf death, they were manned,
in a large proportion, with men of coler.
And, in this very house, in the fall of 1814,
a bill passed. receiving the approbation of ail
the branches of your government, authorizing
the Governor to accept the services of a corps
of two thousand free people of color. St,
these were times, which tried men’s souls.
In these times, it was no sporting matter to
bear arms. These were times, when a msn
who shouldered bis musket did not know but
he bared his bosom to receive a death wound
from the enemy ere he laid it aside ; and. in
these times, these people were found as ready
and as willing to volunteer in your service as
any other. They were net compelled to oo;
they were not drafted. No: your pride had
placed them beyond your compulsory power.
But. there was no necessity for its exercise ;
they were volunteers ; yes, sir, volunteers to
defend that very country from the inroads
and ravages of a ruthless and vindictive foe,
which had treated them with iusult. degrada-
tion and slavery,

Volunteers are the best of soldiers. Give
me the men, whatever be their cowples-
ion, that willingly volunteer, sud not those
who are compelled to turn out, Such men
do not tight) from necessity, nor from
mervenary motives, but from principle.”

The Hon. Tristam Burges, of Rhode Tsl-
and, ins speech in Congress, January,
1828, said — At the commencement of the
Revolutionary War, Rhode Island had a
uumber ofslaves. A regiment of them were
vulisted into the Continental service, and no
braver men met the enemy in batde; but
Net ono of them was permuted to be a soldier
wht) ho had first been a freeman.”

“In Rhode Uslaud,” says Governor Eustis,
in his ablo speech against slavery in Missouri,
12th December, 820, “the Backs formed
an ontive regiment, and thoy discharged their
duty with zeal and fidelity. The gallant de-
tenvo of Rad Bank, in which the black regi
mont bore a part, fs among the proofs ef their
valor.”

In this contest, it will be recollected thst
four hundred men met and repulsed, after a
terrible and sanguinary struggle, fiteeu
hundred Hessian treeps, heads by Count
Donop. The glory ot tho dedenes of Red
Bank, whieh has been pronenneed one of the
most hewie aotions of the war. belongs ta
reality to black omens yer who now hears
thom spoken ef in connection with it?
Among the traits whieh distinguishal the

To chase the glowing hours with flying feet >~ '
where, although I could nor keep step to the music |
“softly sweet, in Lydian measures,” yet TP took al
note of the movement, and cannot retrain from ex: |
pressing my surprise at the rapid advance made by
fashionable females in emancipating themsel es
from the tyranny of the toilet. I noticed, as that:
eminen: naturalist, A. Gasees, remarks in his I
treatise on Tertiary nuges, that the tendency of:
female fashions iz, under favorable circumstances, |
towards Evelike simplicity in the matter of drapery ;
—thait there is a marked evidence of a return to the :
mode of dress which prevailed during the cartier
periods of mantua-making; and to that unadorned |
style of costume which captivated our great pro- -
genitor, Adam, and which Cowper alludes to when |
he informs us that “clothing costly, or for use, |
save their own painted skins, our sires had none.”
Hence, we may infer that among the many ener- '
yating and corrupting habits introduced into’
Britain by the Romans, was that of wearing cloties; |
and that dress may be considered as a sign of that i

decradation which compelled the unhappy Britons,

trembiing in their tunics, to call upon the blue-cred |

Saxon to save them from being Pict up, and to
keep them Scot free. Be that as it may, coming
down to modern times, we finda celebrated writer,
only 150 years ago, bewailing the influence of!
fashion in these words: “The most improper things ©
we commit in the conduct of our lives, we are led |
into by the force of fashion. Instances might be
given, in which a prevailing custom makes us act
agains: the rules of Nature, law, and cominon
ger ¢.””) Now, it must be remembered that at that
period, society dressed absurdly, and I suppose that
the above remarhs were suggested by some pecn-
Harly absard specimen of toile: which had offended
the writer’s sense of propriety.

But much progress has been made since that
time; and fashion, reduced to a science, cultivates
dress as an art; divesting the female figure of the
disigurements with which the vitiated and un-
natural taste of the past has conspired to conceal
Nature’s masterpiece, and enabling Art to perform
its highest function in presenting natural beauties
either to our senses, or to our imagination. ‘

The tendency of this fashionable reforin is down-
ward; that is to say, from the head towards the
fee:. Progress in this respect, like in every other
where aatiquated notions have to be overcome, is
slow; but, judging froin my own recent observa-
tion, I should say that satisfactory results have al- .
ready been reached; warranting the anticipation
of atime, not very remote, when the perfection of
Powers’ and the truthfulness of Pave’s delineation ©
of the female form, may be realized in our ball-;
rooms, end verified in our boudoirs. ;

Apropos to this subject, permit me to present you |
with a specimen of fossilized opinion peculiar to
the class Foyee Antiquus, remains of which are to
be found in the various strata of society, down to
the earlier formations. !

This specimen is suppose] to have been alive and |
grundling in England, about the year 1712. I
bring it forward as a proof of the penchant of fe-

of the opposition which woman has nad to encoun-
ter, and still meets, in her endeavors to throw off |
the coverings that caneral her charena: i

ers taken from our Army. Messrs. Sumner, Fes-

petitions fur the emancipation of the slaves under
the war power, with compensation to loyal mas-
ters. Mr. Kine (N. Y.) presented a petition from
the Mayor and citizens of Rochester, asking that
the example of Washington and Jackson be tul-
lowed in regard to the slaves, and that they be put
to work for the Government. Mr. Carlisle (Va.)
presented a petition from eitizens of Pennsylvania,
stating that slavery was the cause of whe present
war, and praying that no further agitation of the
subject be tolerated in Congress. ‘The Senate went
into executive session, Adjourned.

Hovss.--Mr. Conklin, of New York, called atten-
tion to the fact that on the second day of the session a
resolution Was adupted with reference to the Ball’s
Biull battle to ascertain who was responsible for
that disaster, without proposing an investigation,
The resylution was handed to the Adjutant Gen-
eral, Who submited jt to the Commander-in-Chief.
He (Mr. Conklin,) was unwilling to believe the
Commander-in-Clief? had read the resolution, be-
cause he would not impute to him a design to tritle
vith the House and return an evasive answer. If
he did read it, he certainly misunderstood its pur-
puse. He seemed to have received the im-
pression that a tature inquiry was to be insti-
tuted, and that of a very general character,
and accordingly expressed his opinion to the Ad-
Jutant General, which was) reported to the
Secretary of War, and transmitted to the llouse.
The answer to the resolution did not inform the
House that steps had been taken to inquire who
was to blame for the disaster at Ball’s Bluth ‘The
response was evasive. Nuw tis was a disregard
of privileges of the House, which ought to require
prompt notice, unless we consent to the trampiing
on our rights. Weshould wate with a jealous
eve, the right of wholesome inquiry. ‘The inquiry
related oa great national cxkunity; to the most
atrocious inilitary uiarder ever committed; toon
most humiliating triumph of rebellion—a blunder
sO #ross That every man can see, and none has ever
dared to deny or defend. Besides a defeat and a
lurse Joss of arms aud ammunition, there was a
sacrifice of Y380 men. ‘The resolution was propusced
out of respect to the memory of these men, and in
deference to public propriety and the: self-respect
of the nation, to inquire whether the amilituy
authorities had taken any steps to ascertain who
was responsible for the slaughter of thy sons of
Massachnectts, New York, and Pennsylvania.
[It was proper to state that the Llouse should be ine
formed, and some inquiry should be anade. Gen,
Stone, who was at the dime in command, is a
inember of the regular army. Colonel Baker was
a volunteer. ‘The respective fricnds of these gen-
Hlemen tad raised a question as to the merits of the
¢, involving the cllicieney of the regulays and
volunteers. He had no toleration for such contro.
versy. An inquiry was absolutely necessary.
Suppose it should turn out that Gen. Stoue was
only half-way cither in soldicrship or loyalty, was
that a reason why there should nut be an investi-
wation?. Was that areason why he should) be re-
hieved from responsibility of a disastrous bhunder?
The man who is to blame should fall upon

4s

his kuces and ask pardon. [Tf Baker was  re-
sponsible, most lamentably bas he suffered,
If General Stone was responsible, a greater

weieht of guilt never rested on apy other min,
Mr. Conklin continued at great length, stating that
the battle of Balls Blut was a helbof fire, and he
thought, after the publication of Adjutant Thomas’
report, relative to Gen. Fremont, certainly no pube
lication of any thing connected with the army
should be suppressed, We should know whether
the Comimauder-inhie® hag tiken the pats (0 it |

should make the inquiry with the view of obtaining

offered a preamble, reciting the resvlution hereto-
“ore adopted, and the resporse, concluding: with a

solution that the answer to itis neither responsive
voy satisfactory to the House, and that the Secre-
tary of War be directed to return a further ap wer,
The resolution was opposed by X s. Richard-
son (HL! Bdwards (N.HL,) and Crittenden City.)
Qs NOL a inalter of proper inquiry by the House, be-
ine purely military in its character, Mir. Rdwaeds
said he had most iiaplicit confidence in Gen. Me-

THE PINE TREE PROMENADE,
Wincitisren, Dee, 12, 1860,

Well has it been said (hat “Beauty, without vir-
te, is dike a flower withont: perfume.” Many
flowers there are whieh appear beantiful to the
vey andcive us an ideo what beauty should
consistof, in part, in their perfeet svminetry and
way Dlendingof coloy, while they may be odorless;
yet, should we wish to convey the idea of perfect
heauty, we should hardly mention that of exterior,
regandicss of the many little atoms that tend to
make beauty lasting, and ever remembered with
pleasure; ont, passing by that which only gratified
one sense, we would recommend the other, which,
though possessing an humbler style of beauty (ex.
terior), may, in connection with it, leave athouht
tar more elevating in its nature, than that: left by
the more stately appearing.

There is a Lily, tall and graceful, giving an idea
of beauty in form; then that species of elambering
Rose, in which will be found every shade between
pure white and the deepest crimson; here is form
agd color; but, while looking upon them, expres-
stons of admiration will fall from) our lips, with a
rearecthat “they are without perfume;” but we can
tind beauty perfeet, not only to admire, but love
without a regret.

on the violin, Mr. Boudinvt sang “The Schoolmas-
ter,” with a great deal of effect, and was compli-
mented witha recall, The whole concert was given
under the able direction of My. Horace Waters. At
the present teue, the Asylum is in need of assistance,
and we are glad to see so many interested in its
welfare,
Parton SKATING.—Mr. Samuel Scotron has re-
opened the Skating Academy, on a finer scale than
it has ever been before. The terms are very low,
so as to give everybody a chance to indulge in this
healthy exercise. We would recommend that the
Academy be opened on Saturday afternoons, for
the accommodation of children who are unable to
attend in the evening. An eflicient orchestra is
present every evening. The Academy is in the
Metropolitan Assembly Rooms, and is opened on
Tuesday and Friday evenings.
A New Year’s Sermonx.—The Rev. William
Spelman, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church,
preached his New Year’s Sermon last Sabbath
evening, It occupied nearly an hour in delivering,
and was listened to with intense interest, to the
close. The sermon abounded jn the events of the
», Haytian Emigration, &e. At the close,
he was presented with a purse, by the chiaeh and
cunzrezation, fora New Year’s present. Mr. Spel-
nan is expected to baptize on next Sabbath, atthe
Rev. Dr, Williams’ church in Amity Street, at
about one o’clock,

The compact litde volune which bears the fore-

dustry, exercised in compiling tacts and incidents
in the tife of the Rev. Dr. Cheever. The author
has shown excellent: taste in nor distizaring his
work with high sounding compliments of his. sub-
ject. He modestly approaches his pleasant: theme
with acommendably brief introduc tion, then dashes
into the biography, every point of which is served-
up inthe same laconie style as that which charac:

Owing to the impious perse ion brought to

this litde book we have the basis of Uint volume

Mr. Herries may well teel honored in being the

INVITATION.

Hayti will soon regain her ancient splendor. This
marvellous soil that our fathers, blessed by God,
conquered for us, will soon yield to us the wealth
now hidden in its bosom. Let our black and yel-
low brethren, scattered through the Antilles, and
North and South Aincrica, hasten to codperate
with us in restoring the glory of the Republic,
Mayti is the common country of the black race.
Our ancestors, in taking possession of it, were care-
ful to announce in the Constitution that they pub-
lished, that all the descendants of Africans, and of
the inhabitants of the West Indies, belong by right
to the Haytian family. The idea was grand and
generous,

Listen, then, all ye negrocs and mulattos who, in
the vast Continent of America, suffer from the
prejudices of caste. The Republic calls you; she
invites you to bring to her your arms and your
minds. The regenerating work that she undertakes
interests all colored people and their descendants,
no matter what their origin or where their place of
birth.

Wlayti, regaining her former position, retaking
her ancient sceptre as Queen of the Antilles, will
be a formal denial, most cloquent and peremptory,

our desire and ability to attain a high degree of
civilization, GEFFRARD.

CIROULAR.-—No. I.

To the Blacks, Men of Color, and Indians in the
Caited States and the British North American
Provinces:

Friexps,—I am authorized and instructed by
the Government of the Republic, to offer you, in-
dividually and by communities, a welcome, a home,
and a free homestead, in Hayti.

Such of you as are unable to pay for your pas-
sage will be provided with the means of defray-
Ing it.

Two classes of emigrants are especially invited
—laborers and farmers. None of cither class, or
any class, will ve furnished with passports, who
cannot produce, before sailing, the proofs of good
character for industry and integrity.

To cach family of emigrants, five carreaux * of
fresh and fertile land, capable of growmg all the
fruits and staples of the tropics, will be gratuit-
ously given, on the sole condition that they shall
settle on it and cultivate it, and declare their inten-
tion of becoming citizens of Hayti. To unmarried
men, on similar conditions, two carreaux will be
granted, +

Board and lodging, free of cost, will be furnished
to the emigrants for at least cight days after their
arrival in the jsland,

The government also will find remunerative
work for those of you whose means will not per-
mit you to begin immediately an independent

Emigrants are invited to settle in communities.

Sites for the erection of schools and chapels wiil
be donated by the State, without regard to the re-
ligious belief of the emigrants,

The same protection and civil rights that the
laws pive to Haytians are solemnly guaranteed to
the emigrants.

The fullest religious liberty will be secured to
them; they will never be called on to support the
Roman Catholic Chureh.

No military service will be demanded of them,
excepting that they shall form military companies
and drill themselves once a month.

All the necessary personal effects, machinery and
agricultural instruments introduced by the emi-
grants shall be entered free of duty.

The emigrants shall be at liberty to leave the
country at any moment they please; but those
whose passage shall be patd by government, if
they wish to return before the expiration of three
years, Will be required to refund the money ex-
pended on their account. A contract, fixing tho
amount, will be made with cach emigrant beforo
leaving the continent.

T have been commissioned to superintend the
interests of the emigrants, and charged with tho
entire control of the movement in America, and
all persons, therefore, desiring to avail themselves
ot the invitation and bounty of the Haytian Gov-
ernment are requested to correspond with me.

[shall at once, as directed by the Governnent,
establish a bureau of emigration in Boston, and
publish a Guide Book for the use of those persons
of African or Indian descent who may wish to
make themselves acquainted with the resources of
the country and the disposition of its authorities.

_ Men of. our race dispersed in the United States?
‘Your fate, your social position, inatead of aroclior-
ating, daily becomes worse. The chains of thoee
who are slaves are riveted; and rejadice, mors
implacab'e, perhaps, than servitude, parsnes and
crushes dovn the free. Everything is conteated
with us in that country in whick, nevertheless, they
Loast of liberty; they have invented a new a! lavery
for the free, who believed that they had now no
naster3; it is this hamiliating patronage which is
revolting to your hearts, Philanthropy, in spite of
its noble efforis, seems more powerless than ever
to lead your cause to victory, Contemptand hatred
increase ayainst you, and the people of the United
States desire to eject you from its bosom.

Come, then, to us! the doors of Hayti are open
to you. By happy coincidence, which Providence
secs to Lave brought about in your behalf, Hay
has risen from the long debasement in which a
tyrannical government had held her; liberty is re-
stored there. Come and join us; come an bring
to us & contingent of power, of lizht, of labor;
come, and toxether with us, advance our own com-
mon country in prosperity. - We will come by this
means to the aid of the philanthropista who make
buch generous cfforts to break the chains of those
of our brethren who are still in slavery.

Our institutions are liberal. The covernment is

| mild and moderate. Our soil is virgin and rich—

we have large tracts of good land, nearly all uncal-
tivated, which only need intelligent workmen to
tillthem. Everything assures yon in this country
or a happy future. For these among you who
possess Capital, it will be casy to find at once

trunk and one barrel. All freight over that amonut |

will be charged for, separately from the pa:
ticket, at the rate of 75 cents per barrel er 15
per cubie foot from American ports. The amonat
for all overland freight, when advanced by the
Bureau, will be added to the passage money in the
Contract. This is exclusive of the bedding,—which
goes free. All goods must be boxed up.

VI. The board provided for emigrants will he the

ing spirits, which will not be allowed in our ves-
sels. The following is the fare:

Fmizrants are at liberty to carry, free of expense,
additional provisions to be used on the voyage.
Sltght additions may be made to the nayy rations;

: but the Bureau does not pledze itself to do so.
VIL As efforts have been industriously made by ;

unscrupulous men to misrepresent the conditions
under which emizrants who do not prepay their pas-
sazes, will accept the offers of the Government of
Hayti, it is deemed advisable to publish below,
in full, the contract to be made with them. The
words in italie and within brackets (blank in the
original) are filled up to show precisely the terms
on which a single man can emigrate. It should
be distinctly understood, that no barrier whatever

‘ here all the considerations

place among us. The country offers them imme-
diate resources. They can count on the solicitude
of the Government, and on its special protection.
Our society is ready to adopt them and prepares
for thein a@ fraternal welcome. They will enjoy
that they merit; they

; Will occupy the rank that their respectability as
: signs them—all the things that @ blind and bar-

barous prejudice refuses to them in countries in-
hospitable to our race.

The poorer emizrants shall have the right to all
that their situation demands. The Government
will provide for their first necessities, and will take
the propcr measures to secure to them @ quict and
honorable asylum, as well as to facilitate for them
the means of obtaining employment.

It is very natural that you should ask, before
coming fo an unknown country, what are the
cilities that will be afforded to vou, as well for the
satisfaction of your first needs, as for your defini-
tive settlement. This thought has seriously occa-
pied the Chief of the Republic and his Govern-
ment.

T proceed to stare the determination to which it
has come:

To such of you as are not able to par the ex-

; penses of your passage, aid will be given trom the

public treasury.
Agents, whom I shall presently appoint in the

' United States, will be charged to make the neces-
. Sary arrancements in this respect.

shall pay the sum of cizhteen dollars before em-

barking for the United States, if he did not. pay

for his own passage from this country to Haya.

The Government of Hayti, while they will welcome

all visitors, cannot reasonably be expected to pay

their passages. Hence this provision.
The following is the contract with the emigrants
who do not prepay their passages;
Articles of Agreement.

THis AGREEMENT, made and entered into this
[first] day of [January], A.D., 1881, by and
between James Reprati, of Boston, General
Agent of Emigration, on behalf of the Govern-
ment of the Republic of Hayti, and [John
Smith], hate of [ Detroit, Michigan], and an emi-
grant to Haydi;

Witsessetu: That said James Redpath, on be-
half of the Government of Hayti aforesaid,
averees to provile a passage for said [JoAn Smith]
from the port of | Boston] to the port of [St
Mark) in said Hayti, in the [Brig Lami @
Haiti], leaving the port of [Boston] on or about

the [third] day of [-Zanuary}, 1861, upon the
conditions hereafter tollowing, viz:

First, cid [To > SmithT horeby acknowledges the
reevipt of [a] ticket of passage trom said port
of [Boston] to said port of (St. Mark], in Hayti,
and agrees during the term of said voyage to
provide [Ais} own bedding, and the necessary
utensils tor eating and drinking.

Secondly, in consideration of reeviving the passare
aforesaid, said [Joka Sinith} further agrees,
that if he accepts a grant of land trom che Gev-
ernment of Haydi, under the provisions of the
Jaw on Emigration, approved by His Excellency
the President of the Republic of Hayti, Septem
ber 1, 1800, he will repay to the Treasury of the
Republic of Rayti the sum of feighteen| deliars,
American curreney, within [¢Aree years] trom the
date of this contact

Furthermore, that if trom anv cause said [.7oAn

annexed one condition to the sincerity of their pro-

namely, that the National Assembly should accept
the Constitutional bases. Meanwhile, it continued
its system of usurpation, and desired to control

sovereign power. As far as it was concernee, the
decrees of the National Assembly appeared to have
no existence. Buindly pursuing: the arcomplish-

opposite interests: by personal attacks, if wounded

, COMMERCE OF HAYTI WITH THE U. 8.

No. 11.—Port of New York.—[continven.]

We now publish a list of the

rest, it wonld be a heavy expense without any ade
quate return to the mother-nation,
Now, a3 to the second question, which i3 simply,
shall we aid this Afric-Aincrican to become a power,
or shall we waste ourselves in selfishly abortive at-
tempts, which, like polit measures generally,
have only expediency for their support? Ciearly,
it scems best to aid the whole, rather than a por-
tion. But there are other reasons for sustaining |
an intertropical and Haytian emigration, and these |
are to be found in the position of European gov- |
crnments towards the Antilles, France evidently
hopes that Hayti will seck its protcetion. Spainas
evidently intends, in forcing the annexation of St.
Domingo, ultimately to subjuzate Wayti. Can we
afford this? The natural ally of the Haytians is
the United States—our own commerce with this |
negro Republic is to us the cighth in importance, |
to the Haytian it is the first.

The Haytian journals promise us the first instal-

Sensible of the prize held out by the exigencies
of the hour, to the industry and energy of the cot-

Horating the condition of their people, the states-
men of Hayti have made proffers to the people of
African and Indian descent in North America, to
come over and share with them in the prize now
waiting the hands of industry. The first requisite

multiply—thercfore give Haytilabor and skill, and
the rest will follow. The colored people here want
a home, industrial freedom, a national character,
and social position. Hayti offers all. To every in-
dustrious man of family, it offers to advance the
passage money, to find shelter and work on land-
ing, to give to cach head of a family about sixteen
acres of land, and to cach single man about seven;
to all, citizenship at the end of a year, freedom of
religion, free schools, and all the privileges of na-

Chin. frequently stop here to replenish their

jwater, which is brought off in “tanks,” or

lighters, and is the staple ofthe island. The
native inhabitants (Yamstock), being a mix-

ture of Chinese and African negro, are an,

indolent and filthy race, tuo lary to work for

women of the suldiers, living in miserable
hovels, four ard five ina rom. Provisions
of all kinds are high, and scarce, fresh beef
and pork of an inferior quality being 30

Beauty and Love.

Before eternity to time had shranken,

Around his charms a firm-bound girdle hovered :
No one che lonely path to him discovered.

But shaved the vision’s bliss with noc a erenture,

ty eradding Nanghe's ales alone he tacked hit,
No playinate’s face er camnbols sportive mocked

Then vese he up—switt vani died all resistance —
And gave the boundless universe existence.

Borween them glows a league which forms no cin-

Then Love the heart within those tair locks diet,

Power of a True or Falso Faith.
[TRANSLATED FROM THE PERSIAN.)

When man in error gropes,
Night wnder night still opes:
Goodness is horrer then,
And demons dwell in nen,
But when he thinks aright,
A fount ofdazeling light
From evil’s darkness bursts,
To satiate his chirsts.
Aftaith ef trath and love
Meits hell in heaven above;
A faith of lies, hate, woe,
Sinks heaven in heil below,
Whoever thinks with God
Doth grasp nate’s mighty rod.

The Little Boy that Died.

Tam all alone in my chamber now,
And the midnight: hour is near,

And the faggot’s crack, and the clock’s dull click, !

Are the only sounds [ hear;

And over my soul, in its solitude,
Sweet fcelings of sadness wlide;

For my heart and eves are full when I think
Of the little boy that died.

I went one night to my father’s house—
Went home to the dear ones all,
And softly TL opened the carden-gate,
Aud sofdy the door of the hall;
Mv mother came to meet hor son—
She kissed me and then she sighed,
Am her head felon my neck, and she wept
For the little boy that died.

T shall miss him when the flowers come
In the garden, where he played ;

[ shall miss him more by the fireside
When the towers are all decayed ;

T shall see his toys and bis empty chair,
And the horse he used to ride,

And they will speak with a silent speech
Of the little bow that died.

We shall go home to our Father's house—
‘To our Father’s honse in the skies,

Where the hope of souls shall have no blight,
Our love no broken ties.

We shall roam on the oanks of the river of peace, of nature.

And bathe in its blissful tide,
And one of the joys of life shall be
The litthe boy that died.

moment, to consider our position, and the
ground which we have traversed.
We have passed through a vast extent of

“inhabited country from the western coast of

Africa, all more or less civilized. The semi-
civilization of Senegambia merges into a

‘higher type of refinement when we reach the

Niger ; and this continues along a line of
* ’ . . . oO
midland towns, lying within a narrow belt of

-datitude, until we reach Kooka, and the Lake

Chad. This improvement. in arts: and man-

ners (we cannot say morals, except as to ’

freedom from drunkenness, ) is owing to the
presence and influence of the Moors and Ma-
hometanism. We have looked at the Moors
and Arabs in their own desert homes, to the

north of this belt; and we have found them :

harsh, wild, and eruel ; inferior to the cen-
tral Negroes who have embraced Islamism,
and who trafic with Barbary. Glancing at
| the south of this belt of towns, wo have seen

itism ; a fact which was strongly marked in

are like one of the plagues of Exypt; for it
sects almost impossible to presere any thing
from their ravages, An assault hy aan army:
of the large black ant is thus described: 7

“Toa thick uninterrupted dine about) an!
inch broad, they one morning came suddenly |
marching over the wall of my courteyard 3
and entering the hall which formed my resi- |
dence by day and night, they made straight ;
for ny store-reom ; but unfortunately, my:
couch being in their way, they attacked my
on person most fiercely, and soon obliged §
me to decamp. We then fell upon them, |
Killing those that were straggling about, fora- |
ging, and Iurning the chief body of the,
ary as itcame marching along the path. :
But fresh legions came up, and tt took us at:
least two hours, before we could fairly break |
the lines and put the remainder of the enemy |
to flight.”

Yet these ants have their use. They
cleanse the huts of the negroes by devouring
refuse, and killing all kinds of vermin, not
exeepting mice. ‘The stores of eorn which
they Jay up for future use are sought out |
and plundered hy the poor people. — Differ-|
ent species of the ant tribe, black, red, and |
white, fight with and devour one another, |
so that their intestine wars tend tu keep
down their numbers.

We are now prepared to look at Magsefia, |
the capital of Baghirni. tt has a ruinous;
appearance ; indeed, the walls are in such a!
condition, that the ates appear to be only}
of nominal use. The houses are. of clay, ;
thatehed with grass, and of frail construe:
tion, so that they do net seem to he proof’,
against a violent storm. You aay) go. to!
market any day during some hours of the;
morning and afternoon, and you will find a;
pretty goad supply of onious, beans, eround-
nuts, milk, and red pepper, with a few sheep
nd cattle. Beads trom Burope are brought
here in large quantities, and are retailed in
the adjacent petty states,

{

Here is the palace,—a_ large, rectangular!
court, having other courts within it, some of;
which are fall of huts. As the sultan is said ;
to have between three and four hundred
wives, each of whom has her own nest, con-
structed after her own taste, the agglomera-
tion of these dwellings would present a sin-
gular appearance toa travelle:, if he could
gain admission into the women’s quarter of!
the roval residence. And we can imagine
the fright which must ensue from the fall of
some of these frail tenements during a storm
—an accilent which sometimes happens,
filling the royal precinets with an uproarious
noise of female voices, as if an enemy were
storming the town.

Here, as at Loggun, a stranger must ad-
ess the king, seated behind a screen, so

every place. After receiving your presents,
the sultan would probably offer in) return a
handsome female slave ; as this is the most
valuable commodity in these regions. — If
she-be refused, he would send you a number
of shirts, which you could dispose of in’ the
market. ‘The tribute which the sultan pays
to the King of Waday, every third year,
consists of a hundred male slaves, thirty
handsome female slaves, a hundred horses,
and a thousand shirts, with ten female slaves,
four horses, and forty shirts, to the inspector
of the province. In order to pay this de-
mand, and also to satisfy the Sheik of Bor-
nu, le levies a similar impost on a number
of pagan tribes whom he has subjugated.
‘Thus slaves form the larger currency, and
shirts the small currency of the kingdom !
All foreign supplies come through Waday or
Bornu; the desert to the north being too
difficult for caravans to cross.

Baghirmi is nominally Mahometan. — Be-
tween two and three hundred years ago Ab-
dallah introduced Islamism, and extended
the bounds of the kingdom. Yet, though
mosyttes are reared and the forms of Mahom-
etan worship are kept up, the hearts aud
manners of the natives have not yet heen
converted, ‘Phe language is similar to that
of Kooka. ‘The marriage tie is held ina
very loose way; divorces are easily made ;
and some of the people contract matches
merely for a limited period.

The sultan is returning in triumph after
a campaign against some pagan tribes!
His procession exhibits the characteristics of
barbaric pomp and pride. The lieutenant-
governor rides first, surrounded by a troop
of horsemen. Next comes the darma, be-
hind whom a long spear of peculiar figure is
horne, connected with some religious super-
stiticn. = The commander-in-chiet_ follews,
and immediately behind him the sultan, ona
grey charger, dressed ina war-cloth. Ile is
covered with a yellow hernouse, aud is shaded
hy two umbrellas, one green and the other
yellow, held over him by slaves. Six slaves
having their right arms clad with iron, fan
his majesty with ostrich feathers fastened
on poles, Five chiefs and other princes
ride beside him. Some are clothed in ber-
nooses, some in black shirts, and some in
blue ; their hands are generally uncovered.
After this motley group is the war-camel, on
which a drummer is mounted, beating two
kettle-drums, fastened one on each side of
the animal. Near him are three mounted
musicians.

The next part of the provession ineludes
a long line of the sultan’s favorite coneubines
on horseback, dressed in black, each having
a slave on either side, ‘The baggage camels
follow, and the infantry bring up the rear.
When the monarch enters the town, after
some days spent in the camp, the principal
captives are led in tirumph in the procession,
and are then subject to the insults of the ha-
rem, after which they are made eunuchs or
put to death.

As Baghirmi is chiefly a flat country in-
tersected hy streams, it is rich in natural
productions, ‘I'he soil is partly lime, partly
sand. The people chiefly live on Negro
millet (penrisefien), but also grow sorghum
and beans (sesamunr) with some ground-
nuts, water-melons, and onions. ‘They eat
grasses, as the pou Abyssinia, and tho leaves
of certain trees which are nutritious. Rice
is hero a wild plant. Tho natives rear a
little cotton and indigo for their own use,

monkey: bread, and syeamore. ‘The whole
population has been reckoned ata inilltion
and a halt, of whom many are slaves. ‘They
have few firearms or bows, but chiefly use
the spear anda kind of band-bill.

We’ should have no disposition to pass
through the wilds of Africa east of Baghir-
mi. Native traders and pilgrims perform
that long journey in caravans, and according
to their acount are subject to many hard-
ships on the road, Sul, it is nothing like
crossing cither the Great or Little Desert of
the north. For here are fertile spots and
onses at no great distance from one another,
where water and shelter may be had, and
provisions may be obtained from wandering
Arabs.

The first country is Waday, of which the
sapital used to-be Wara; but a late sultan
changed it for sceurity to Abeshr, situated
ina desert place, in the tribe of the Kelin-
ven, It is a wild, strage¢ling kingdom,
nominally extending from 15° to 28° of
east longitude. ‘The country is mostly
level, interspersed with barren mountains,
and the northern portions are very desert.
A. caravan proceeds at the rate of about
ten miles a day, and its journey to Darfur
has been thus described by pilgrims :—
From Wara, you travel over rocky hills and
a wide wilderness for seven days, when you
will reach Doomta, 2 frontier town of Dar-
fur, Your next march of eight days lies
through Waday Bareh, a thickly peopled
valley, to Kebkabiyeh, a good town of the
Jellaba, with clay houses and a market.
About eight days more would bring you to
the eapital of Darfur, the route to which is
partly through a wilderness inhabited by the
Jelluba.

Where the people of this region are not
Arabs, they are Negroes of the complete Ne-
gro type, living in the simplest and rudest
forms of life, yet not so much savage as un-
civilized. It is chiefly from the neighboring
districts, that those slaves are procured whom
the traveller has seen brought down the
river in cargoes to Meypt for sale. They
are short in stature, dumpy, flat-nosed, thick-
lipped, woolly-hended, black as a coal, al-
most naked, with little thought and little
care.

Cobbé is generally ealled the capital of
Darfur, though the king usually resides a
little way off. But native and foreign met-
chants have their residence sn this town, and
with their numerous slayes form the bulk of
its inhabitants. ‘Lhe whole population is
about six thousand. ‘They have a mosque,
and profess to be Mussulm-n, But come!
take a peep within one of iese mud walls,
which inclose some mud h +; and you may

ran; but indulge in polygs..., 0 the extent
of their means.

If you had goods to dispose of in Cobbé,
you would require all your wit, and even
nore to prevent yourself from being flecced.
There being no circulating metium, trade is
conducted by barter, in which a_ practised
native will always get the advantage of a
stranger. Nor would your property be safe
at any time out of your sight. Indeed, the
eharacter of the people is wholly bad, being
roguish and licentious in the extreme.

Suppose we wero admitted, with Mr.
Browne, to an audience of the sultan. We
find him seated on what must be called a
throne, a bank spread with small Turkey
carpets, and covered with a canopy of foreign
light stuffs. Behind him is a file of guards
armed with spear and shield, each having a
black ostrich feather in his cap, Some chief
men sit on either side of the throne, at a
little distance, whilst a crowd of spectators
and petitioners fill the space in front. A
trumpeter of the king’s praises stands on
his left hand, ever and anon reminding the
people, lest they should forget that he is a
person not to be despised: “See the bul
falo, the offspring ofa buffalo! a bull of
bulls! the elephant of’ superior strength !
the powerful sultan Abd-el-rach-man-el-rash-
id!” So that physieal strength, not wis-
dom or goodness, is the great boast of a
Darfurian monarch !

His majesty is a merehant on his own ac-
count, speculating in gools bronght by the
caravans. ‘These are sometimes large, mum-
bering two thousand camels ; for Cobbé is
on the line of route between the interior of
Africa and all eastern places, as Sennaai and
Abyssinia, Nubia and Egypt, and Mecea by
Suakem and Jidda. It has, therefore, its
full share of trafic, on which it principally
depends.

‘The king is also a nominal husbandman ;
for when the annual rains introduce the sow-
ing season, he goes out into the field with
his attendants, and with his royal hand
makes the first holes in the ground. Millet
is chiefly grown; which being made into
flour and boiled, is eaten with milk, or with
the juice of a bitter herb. Melons, gourds,
Cayenne pepper, tobacco, and a little wheat
are also raised. ‘The tamarind, palm, and
syeamore trees grow in favorable situations.
All the wild beasts which we have met with
in the interior infest tho thinly peopled plains
of Darfur, and prowl about the villages, to
make a prey of the cattle, of which the peo-
ple have abundance. Gold and copper are
found in this region.

It is a toilsome journey of more than four
hundred miles, through a barren district,
from Cobbé to Sennaar on the banks of the
Nile; but when this is achieved, the great
span of Africa has been nearly traversed.
The town of Sennaar depends on trade, and
is therefore better built and more refined than
other places in the neighborhood. ‘Tho
houses are made of clay mixed with straw.
The best have two stories and a flat roof, and
tho floors are carpeted. ‘Tho climate is un-
healthy, though the soil is fertile. ‘l'ho
horsos and cattle aro very fine. A nominal
Mahometanism prevails.

Ono of the most singular institutions of
this country in former times was the frail
tenure of royal power. ‘Lhe king appeared
to bo a mere puppet, set up to amuse the
people, but entirely controlled by the officers
of the court. A council of thoso dignitaries

to its own vagaries.

™ ondy, which »eo7 te ba a avast clew

could deerce that it was no longer for the
public good that the reigning sovercign should
continue to exist; on which, he was put to
death by an officer who lived with him, as
master of his houschold, and a relation of
his family. ‘his oflicer did not consider his
bloody function to be at all derogatory to his
dignity, nor even to interfere with his friend-
ship for the royal personage. When the
tine had come for the monarch to die, it was
better that his throat should be decently cut
by a friend in his own palace, than that he
should he murdered by a mob or an assassin.
So, also, with all the princes exeept the
eldest who ascended the dirone. ‘The public
advantage demanded their death ; and it was
well for it. to take place in a decent and or-
derly manner. Princesses were of no esti-
mation in Sennaar, and were not regarded
with more respeet than private women ; so
that when their father was killed, they were
very badly off, if not previously married.

A long shirt of blue cloth is the usual
clothing of the people both men and women ;
the men sometimes gird it round their waist
with a sash, ‘hey always go barefooted in
the house.

If you professed to be a merical man you
might, like Mr. Bruce, have obtained an in-
terview with the royal ladies. Te was first
introduced intoa large apartment full of black
women without apparel, excepting a narrow
piece of cotton round their waists.
these ladies in waiting led him into another
chamber better lighted than the former,
Here, ona bench covered with cloth. were
seated some of the king’s wives, clothed in
the blue shirt above mentioned. But they
also wore jewels of gold, large rings passed
through the under lip, the ears and the nose ;
with chains round the neck, the wrists, and
ankles. ‘Their features were quite distorted

Berbers. ‘his name is sometimes given to
any Nubian; but it properly belongs toa
small district consisting of a few villages in-
habited by Arabs of the tribe of Meyrefal.
A tall, slender, handsome set of people, are
these Berbers; of dark color; showing
nothing of the Negro shape or countenance,
except a little thickness of the upper lip.
Their hair is bushy, not woolly ; and they
have a beard under the chin, ‘They blacken
their eyes, to make them of-a-piece with the
rest of their appearance. Young girls wear
only a leathern girdle, a custom whieh pre-
vails in extensive districts of Africa; the
other natives have shirts or tunics.

These Berbers are a gay, frolicsome, and
treacherous people ; combining the fun of
the Negro with the eunning of the Arab.
‘They have been spoken of as full of all
wickedness; but are probably not worse
than other denizens of these regions, though
their Arab astutencss renders them more
elever in sin. A Berber makes a good

of their dwelling-place, most Berbers have
two apartments for the family, a third for a
storehouse, another for strangers, and a fitth
for public women. ‘The latter are accomo-
dated for a season in different families, and
so change ahout for the public eonvenience.
The inner court of the house is a place for
eattle and fodder, ‘The furniture is like
that found in the dwellings of Negroes or
Arabs. It consists of a few necessary uten-
sils, and a wooden frame covered with reeds

thrown, to serve asa sofa by day and a bed

strangers by means of the public women
lodging in their houses. ‘These females
serve for decoys. When a Inckless wight
has been seduced by one of them, the master
of the house pretends that a relative of his
own has been dishonored, makes a great fuss
about the matter, and finally lets the stranger
off on payment of supposed damages. ‘This
decoying is more easily effected by means of
their drinking parties, in which they furnish
large quantities of booza, until most of the
guests are intoxicated.

The route through the Nubian desert to
Heypt is not so bad as most of those we have
deseribed. Stations and wells are more fre-
quent in these parts ; so that, with proper
preeautions, the journey may be made with-
out much difficulty or suffering. But Arab
guides sometimes wilfully deceive travellers,
‘and lead them out of the right way, that
they may make a gain of them, or plunder
their efiects in case of their perishing from
want. ‘Tho Simoom prevails here, like the
whirlwinds of sand we have already men-
tioned. When overtaken by this blast the
Arabs kneel down and wrap their faees in
their cloak, whilst their emnels turn round
and hold down their heads, ‘The great fear
is not of being poisoned, as Muropeans com-
monly think, but of being stifled by the sand.

But melancholy accidents sometimes hap-
pen in this desert; as may be seen from the
following account furnished by an Arabian
merchant who was travelling ina caravan.

When we had performed five days’
journey in the mountains, our stock of water
was exhausted ; and we did not yet know
where we were in. the wide desert. We de-
termined, therefore, to go towards tho set-
ting sun, hoping thus to reach some part of
the Nile. No relief appeared ; and during
a march of tio days without water, one mer-
chant and fifteen slaves sunk down exhausted
and died, Another, feeling that he could
not hold out much longer, and hoping that
his camels might find the road to water bet-
ter than men could, had himself ticd on one
of his beasts, and let them’ take their own
way ; but we never heard more of them, and
they doubtless perished. After another day’s
journey, we came within sight of a mountain
which somo of us knew, but neither we nor
our camels could travel farthor. We laid
ourselves under a rock to obtain a little
shelter from the san, and sent two of our

strongest servants and camels to go and,

search for water. Our existence depended
upon their success.

The two men pushed forward, but before
they reached the mountain where they hoped
to find'a well, one of them ‘succumbed and
fell from his camel. _ Unable to speak, -he
waved his hand: for his companion té leave
him to his fate, and to hasten onward. ‘The

he was restored, they hastened to the well,
filled their skins, and returned to the place
where we were lying. They fourd us still
alive, though we had given ourselves up to
death. Water quickly revived us, and after
a short time we were able to pursue our
journey, and we reached our destination in
safety. We gave the Bedouin a slave for
his trouble in saving our lives.

Instead of turning to the south from Sen-
naar, in order to have a veep at Nubia, we
might have proceeded eastward with a cara-
van to Abyssinia. As this is the only inde-
pendent country of native Africans who have
retained a profession of Christianity, it may
be well to see if their religion has done-them
any good, and made them superior to Mus-
sulmen and Pagans. We fear, alas! that

they are no better than their neighbors.

The morals of the palace were imitated by
the people. They -had no marriage form, and
no matrimonial bond, but that of coneent, for
as long a time as the parties. pleased. The
men used not to market, or carry bread or
water, yet they washed all clothes, even those
of the women. The women were covered
from the chin to the ground, it being a dis-
grace to have even their hands: or feet seen
in public. Will you keep this in memory,
and then receive, if you can, this strange ac-
count of a bacchanalian revelry, which Mr.
Bruce describes as a real occurrence !

The guests are assembled in a quict hall.
A living bullock is’ hound and laid down
outside the door. A. slight incision is mado
in its neck to save the letter of the law, that
its blood must fall on the ground. The skin
is stripped from its buttock, and thin pieces
of ficsh are cut out, without touching any of
the great arteries. ‘Chese are carried into

he performs the same good office for his fair
companions. ‘Then they drink together, and

appeals are likely to be often made in a place
of such corruption as Gondar. Whether or
not his majesty satisfies them all, when he is

Gondar itself is situated on a hill, and
contains perhaps 10,000 inhabitants, for its
population is greatly reduced. Its houses
are round, built of stone and clay, and
thatched in form of a cone. The palace is
a large square edifice, the ruins of one built
by the Portuguese. A few of the rooms are
still tenantable, and huts are erected beside
‘them ; the whole surrounded by a stone wall
thirty feet high. The streets of the town are
very narrow, crooked, filthy, and often steep,
Las the city lies upon a rising ground.

The country is full of churches. The kings
have built many ; and others have been
erected by rich people, in the way of atone-
ment for their sins. They are generally situ-
ated on the top of a hill, and near a stream,

traveller’s book, and give a few cursory
notes of what was then passing in Gondar.

of a mitre, covering the forehead, cheeks, and

into church, when his guards possessed the

officers on whom he leaned. He rode on
his mule into his palace, up stairs, and over
his Persian carpets, to the very foot of his
divan. Te had six noblemen of the bed-
chamber, and many other ofticers of state. It
was death to sit on the king’s seat. He ate
wheaten bread grown in a certain province
called the royal provinee.

strangers, who were allowed to salute tho
Abyssinian monareh in the same way as they
do their own sovereign. ‘To strangers of
note the king alloted a village or two, which
furnished them with supplies of food. He
sent for any woman he pleased to have,
and: made her his wife or concubine without
eeremony. But the chief wife alone was
queen. When he elected a lady to this
honor, the judge pronounced in his presence,
and on his behalf, that the king has chosen
his handmaid Itagho; then the crown was
placed on her head. As there are many
royal princes, and only one could succeed to
the throne, the rest were sent to a mountain;
where they were maintained at the public
expense. Tho crown was hereditary, but

:appearance. ‘They are circular in form,
thatched, and surrounded with a colonnade,
supported by wooden pillars. They are di-
vided in the interior, to imitate the old Jew-
ish sanctuary. You may enter barefooted,
that is, if you are pure; (which is not the
case with many men ;) otherwise you must
pray among the cedars. But when you go
in, take care that your shoes be not stolen by
the priests or monks, if they be worth steal-
ing. The walls are hung with pictures, or
daubs of saints. There are no images or
carved work; as this would be a breach
of the second commandment of the Deca-
logue, which is not supposed to be broken by
a worship of pictures.

The abuna‘or patriarch is, in some respects,
aman of authority, at least in religious mat-
ters. 1f any men come'to him, desiring to
be made monks, he gives the word of com-
mand, and they become monks without any
other ceremony. In the'same summary way
he makes priests and deacons. Besides these
ecclesiasties, there is a chief of the monks,
chief priests, and scribes or copyists. The
monks live in their own houses, built round
the church which they serve. The whole lot
of ecclesiastics are, with’ a few exceptions,
very ignorant and very stupid. Their great
delight is to wrangle about useless or contro-
verted points of religion. Poor Bruce was
almost losing the royal’ favor, because he
would not decide that Nebuchadnezzar was a
saint. ‘The ground’ for this supposed saint-
ship was the expression that he was God’s
“servant.”” The wrangles produce incessant
quarrels and excommunications, often fol-
lowed by bloody broils. The people are cir
cumcised on the eighth day.

The importance of the sovereign, and along’
with it the lordliness of the male sex, seem
to have been on the wane during the last
century, in Abyssinia. Dr. Gobat represents’
the grandson of the monarch who pleaded
for the saintship of Nebuchadnezzar, (and
whoni he scems'to have striven to imitate,)
as'an old man, living'in a plain way, in a lit-
tle cireular house; built amid the runs of the
ancient palace. Three large rooms, and
‘gome small ones, which remained of this no-
lo structure, were ‘full of dust and. filth.
